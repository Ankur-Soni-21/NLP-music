    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the sentiment of the various transcripts, both overall and throughout the comedy routine."

       "[['Death and Other Details\\nSeason 1 Episode 6\\nEpisode Title: Tragic\\nOriginal release date: February 13, 2024 (Hulu) “Tragic,” the sixth episode of Death and Other Details, begins with a glimpse into the past, showcasing Rufus’s acclaim as a detective, and quickly moves to the present where Imogene’s entanglements with Sunil deepen amidst a backdrop of espionage and surveillance orchestrated by the enigmatic Viktor Sams. The episode intricately lays out a series of events that unravel secrets and alliances. From the revelation of Sunil’s financial desperation leading to his unsavory alliance with Sams, to the unexpected murder of Alexandra, a character intent on exposing corporate malfeasance, the narrative is rich with twists. The episode weaves through various settings and character interactions, including a poignant karaoke session highlighting personal despair, a startling act of violence rooted in a misdirected quest for justice, and the tragic end of Llewellyn, a character overwhelmed by guilt and secrets. The tension escalates with the discovery of a slow-poisoning murder, hinting at a deep-seated conspiracy involving Sams. * * * [dial-up internet sound] [typing] [ringing] [mouse clicks] [through computer] Well, joining us tonight is the upstart private eye who solved the impossible crime. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Rufus Cotesworth. [audience clapping] Now… Mr. Cotesworth, how did you discover the necklace? Paint. [Audience laughing] No, really. For anyone who has applied wallpaper to freshly painted walls, you know you should allow the paint to dry for at least 30 days before sticking anything to it. Right, ladies? [Audience laughing] Well, the palace had been freshly painted, pristine, except a patch was missing from the back doorjamb. Now, when pressed, the contessa’s nanny admitted… she had taped over the lock every Wednesday night, so that her Belgian beau could sneak in. Now that I had identified the Belgian thief, the real challenge… was how to retrieve the necklace before he moved it through the black market, never to be seen again. Fortunately, even great thieves love one thing above all: Gossip. [audience laughing] All it took was a few free drinks and my ability to play dumb. For you to accomplish what Scotland Yard and MI5 couldn’t. Hm. Ladies and gentlemen, Rufus Cotesworth, and let me be the first to say, the world’s greatest detective. His words, not mine.

       " ['In “Get on Your Knees,” Jacqueline Novak transcends the typical stand-up comedy show by delivering a unique blend of personal anecdotes and intellectual exploration into the act of oral sex, transforming it into a theatrical experience at the Cherry Lane Theater. Stripping away the primal elements typically associated with the act, Novak invites the audience into a cerebral discussion on the subject, humorously dissecting its semantics, cultural perceptions, and the juxtaposition of physical desire with intellectual analysis. Her performance, characterized by self-deprecation, sharp wit, and a refusal to conform to conventional comedic tactics, offers a fresh perspective on gender dynamics, sexual expectations, and the often-comical reality of embodying a “thinking, feeling, desiring body” in a society filled with contradictions. Through her insightful and comedic lens, Novak navigates the complexities of sexual identity and expression, making “Get on Your Knees” a thought-provoking reflection on the absurdity of human sexuality. * * * [“Like a Prayer” by Madonna playing] [horn honking] ♪ Life is a mystery ♪ ♪ Everyone must stand alone ♪ ♪ I hear you call my name ♪ ♪ And it feels like ♪ ♪ Home ♪ [crowd cheers] ♪ When you call my name ♪ ♪ It’s like a little prayer ♪ ♪ I’m down on my knees ♪ ♪ I wanna take you there ♪ ♪ In the midnight hour ♪ ♪ I can feel your power ♪ ♪ Just like a prayer ♪ ♪ You know I’ll take you there ♪ Thank you. Despite… Despite your warm welcome, that journey was hell. [audience laughing] The journey from backstage to a microphone always is. It’s fraught. And it’s ’cause for me what it reminds me of, frankly, uh, is the journey, you know… [audience chuckling] …from someone’s face, down their torso… [audience laughing] …to their pelvis, to give them a blow job. ‘Cause the whole way there, both scenarios, everyone knows what you’re headed to do, but you’re not yet doing the thing, so there’s just this question hanging in the air the whole way of, “Can she do it?” I mean, “Will she do the thing we’re all here for well or badly?” And oh God, the uncertainty, the [exhales]… the tenuousness. I mean… [exhaling] Can you feel it? [audience laughing] I am gonna talk about the blow job quite a bit tonight. “To the point of tedium,” said one early critic. [audience laughing] I think I do it in a way that allows us all to maintain our dignity. Uh, if you’re here with a parent or a sibling, it will be okay. I’m very concerned with dignity. I’m someone that, for example, prefers to call “doggy style” “the Hound’s Way.” [audience laughing] I think the position deserves a term with some gravitas. I think it’s one of our more noble positions. I feel like any of these positions where you’re staring into the eyes of your lover, you know, as if to become one, there’s something immature there, I’m not impressed. [audience laughing] To me, the Hound’s Way, it represents a more mature kind of love, where two lovers can look towards the future together. [audience laughing] You know, it’s not… it’s not sad. It’s not sad that I’m not looking at him, that I’m not making eye contact with him. Because it’s more like… it’s more like we’re these two pioneers headed west. And I gotta keep my eye on that horizon ’cause these are… these are tough times. [audience laughing] [chuckling] But I’m a strong woman. I know hubbin’s gotten from behind. I feel him bringing it up the caboose. I just gotta put my face into the wind and keep on keeping on through this good night ’cause our young nation depends on it. That sort of thing. [audience laughing] I do have a sort of poetic sensibility I like to warn people about at the top of the show because I know it can be trying at times. I can’t help myself. Yeah, I used to write poetry in college. Like many, I gave it up. I grew tired. I grew tired of being in a constant state of enchantment. [audience laughing] You know, just so many hours spent curled in windowsills, just the muscles cramping, the eyes drying out from all that wonderment, just… Every night seeing the moon as if for the first goddamn time. I just wanted to grow accustomed to the moon, you know? I wanted to take moonlight for granted, like other girls. [audience laughing] I hope you’ve taken your opportunity by now just to, you know, take in my physical form. Uh… That is your right, you know. [chuckles] I take the stage, you show up, you get to look, and fair enough. Fair enough. But it is a nightmare, it is a nightmare for an intellectual like myself. [audience laughing] Really to be incarnate at all, frankly. I mean, as a woman of ideas on some level, everything, everything from the chin down feels beneath me. I don’t know what else to say. “Limbs and torso, there she goes.” All a bit common. You know? The female form, this female form of mine, this sort of sack of sex potatoes, you know, this tits and ass that can’t leave home without, oh, an explanation for. “Why would you bring those out if you didn’t bring enough for the class?” [audience laughing] I can’t leave them at home. No taters for sale tonight. You know? No. No, I like to keep it moving on stage ’cause I know, I know how you people operate. Okay, okay, I stand still for too long, you see something you like, you take a mental snapshot. Who knows what you’ll do with it later? I… I much prefer… I prefer to keep things moving, keep ’em blurry. Thank you very much. Try to take a mental snapshot and it’s nothing but a gray blur. Simple self-preservation. No, I look forward to it. I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, through death, of course, as a ghost. [audience laughing] Specifically. I look forward to being a ghost, think of myself as a future ghost, the body as training wheels I can’t wait to cast off and fly free. You know? Not too free, of course. In order to become a ghost, you gotta get stuck here, and I’ll do what it takes. You know? You know, manufacture some unfinished business, do what’s necessary. My meditation practice these days, it’s getting too strong, you know? It’s getting too consistent where spiritually I’m kind of in a place where I die I sort of instantly transcend, instantly dissolve into the one. And that’s not what I want. I want to linger. Do you see, I wanna linger as me. I want to haunt a house, and I know perhaps that’s a quaint dream, you know, unoriginal, but it’s mine, nonetheless. I mean, imagine. To night after night, to night after night just watch television behind someone watching television. [audience laughing] Just giving yourself over to their programming choices. I mean, that… that would be a meditation in its own right, the surrender required there, you know. I just, uh… I wanna be a ghost, but if I make it as a ghost, I wanna be a strong ghost, a robust ghost, you know. No blurring away at the edges for me. I wanna have fully articulating fingertips. I want to be 75% opacity at minimum. [audience laughing] I’d say 85 max. I want you to know I’m a ghost. Otherwise, what’s the point? [audience laughing] Primarily you just wanna make sure you don’t end up as one of these orb figures, uh, the orb characters, they’re kinda the embarrassment of the ghost community, depending on who you talk to. [chuckles] I don’t know if you guys watch quite as much nonfiction, paranormal programming inside the home as I do. I watch quite a bit. I’m a lifelong learner. [audience laughing] But if you don’t know… if you don’t know the orbs, those are those, uh, small, transparent circles of light that occasionally appear in a photograph and someone’ll say, “Oh, great-grandmother did come to the wedding.” It’s nice. It’s really nice stuff. [audience chuckling] But people are so rude about orbs. I mean, if you try to talk about an orb with anything resembling seriousness, they come for you. They simply come for you, you know? And it’s just so rude. I mean, because imagine if you were the great-grandmother and you did it, you know? You managed to gather your strength in the afterlife and appear for your family as anything at all. I mean, a little circle, that’s pretty good. I mean, have any of you ever made yourselves appear as anything at all using your consciousness alone? I certainly haven’t. [audience laughing] One of the basic shapes. And then to be dismissed, just summarily dismissed by some surely unrigorous skeptic of a great-grandson. [laughs] I will not have that happen to me. No, everyone will know who’s present. It’ll be, “Hi, Johnny, it’s me.” You know? But that’s not the point. That’s not the point. Well, you know, if you insist on such a thing and you would, wouldn’t you? No, the point is I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, uh, its needs, its wants, you know, all hideousities to me, uh… I am what many would historically call a heterosexual woman, and no, I’m not proud. [audience laughing] It’s a patent humiliation in this day and age. I know what you’re thinking. Does she even read? [audience laughing] And I do, I do, and yet, you know, how can I when I’m just a… a girl with a ponytail just lusting after the common shaft? [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t believe it happened to me. I mean, just that simple cylinder, that… that familiar tube, that object of seemingly no nuance. The word I’m avoiding saying, of course, is “penis” and now I’ve said it. And do I feel better? No, I don’t. [audience laughing] I don’t love the word, few do, you know. A big part of me would probably rather say the word “cock” for you people. I think a lot of you’d rather hear it. The boyfriends sure did, you know? [audience laughing] Cock is a good word, it has a kind of dignity to it. You know, you gotta wind it up and kick it from the back of your mouth. “Co” but then “ck.” ',\n",
       "  'It lands. A “ck, ck.” It lands on the same damn consonant it started on, you know? Penis. Penis just sort of slips out the side of the mouth. [audience laughing] “Penis.” “I’m sorry. Did you say something?” “Well, I’m not sure anymore.” “I thought a word and I felt something happen.” You know? People say, people say, “Well sure, I wouldn’t use the word penis sexually, it’s too clinical.” I don’t hear the voice of the clinician in that word. I don’t think penis is our most medical-sounding word. I mean [chuckling]… I think the problem for people… I think the problem for people with the word penis lies in its sort of tender emotionality. I don’t think the word penis is a problem for people ’cause it sounds accurate to what it is. Penis. Penis. [chuckles] It sounds like a soft heartbeat. Penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis. And I think that’s the problem. I think… I think… I think the problem lies in the syllables themselves too. I don’t think this is one of these Rose-by-any-other-name scenarios. No, “Pe-” is clearly a problem. Pe… Peener… Pee-pee. You know, it’s been mocked for ages and rightfully so. You know? But to me, the true… the true tender syllable of devastation, oh, it’s the “nis.” It’s the “nis.” [audience laughing] I mean, can you believe that’s been there the whole time? “Nis.” “Nis.” And that’s why no one speaks of that syllable. That’s why… that’s why no one says, you know, “Show me that nis.” [audience laughing] Wait till you see this nis? Nis-nis? They won’t even make a joke. No, it’s too tender. It cannot be spoken. No, “cock” clearly, clearly… “cock…” Clearly “cock” is the sexy word. You know? But there’s an issue. There’s a problem with the word “cock” for me. In a way, it becomes unsexy. And the problem is that when I call the penis a cock, I’m not actually calling it like I see it. [audience laughing] I’m kind of telling it what I think it wants to hear. [audience laughing] I’m worrying about the feelings of the penis. I’m coddling the little ego of the penis. I’m humoring the penis. Like, when I call the penis a cock, I don’t throw it away. It’s not cock, it’s cock. “Who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” [audience laughing] When I call a penis a cock, I’m humoring it. Like I might humor my little nephew, for example, or a friend’s son, you know? [laughs] You know, one of these guys, these over and down guys. These little… the person I love and the little guy below them. Like… when I call the penis a cock, I treat it like I treat my little nephew. He’ll come running into the kitchen where the adults are talking wearing a little monster mask or something, and we… we see him and it’s sort of like, “Oh, sorry, sorry… Ah!” and then right back to talking. [audience laughing] ‘Cause he didn’t scare us. He was unsuccessful in his little ruse. [audience laughing] And you hear his feet… you know, he’s coming around again. You give him it even faster the second time. “Ah!” Right back to it. No showmanship… [laughs] …and yet he’s been rewarded. Now… Do you love your nephew? Of course. But do you respect him? [audience laughing] I don’t think you do. No, no, true respect… true respect for the nephew isn’t “Ah!” Right? No, true respect for the nephew is “What? No, you didn’t scare me, but I believe you can.” “So… so try again.” And to me, it’s the same with the penis. True respect for the penis, you know, it’s not, “Oh, who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” Right? True respect for the penis is, “Penis.” [moaning] [audience laughing] If the penis is enough, then the word “penis” should suffice, you know? If the penis has a chance at being sexy, then the word penis should have a chance at being sexy. And in theory… in theory, it’s enough, you know? You know? In theory, it suffices. I mean, arguably, I’m a fan in the sense that I show up for it time and again with a regularity you can count on. I’m a sort of church mouse to the wafer crumb on Monday morning. There’s me. Sniffing about, hoping for a taste of the divine. So if the penis isn’t the fucking cock, that I feel like I have to act like it is in its presence, but I’m still showing up for it. I’m still a fan. Then what am I showing up for? What is the penis to me? What is its nature? [exhales] [audience chuckling] Well, it’s tender. It’s responsive. You know, it’s like… [audience laughing] It springs up under certain conditions. That’s why I think it has the soul of an artist, you know. [audience laughing] It sees something that intrigues it and it sort of… [audience laughing] It fills with inspiration. And it is a filling to me. It is a filling to me much more than it is a… [clicking] …erection. I think erection’s a little architectural for what’s happening there. I don’t think anyone should go in that building, I don’t think it’s safe. It’s not up to code. [audience laughing] And unlike a building, it doesn’t… it doesn’t topple, it withers. It dies on the vine. [audience laughing] The penis… the penis, it blooms and it withers and it blooms again. This kind of eternal flower stretching towards that which nurtures it, you know, as if warmed by the sun. I mean, it’s moving. It’s a romantic figure, a boldly romantic figure. I mean, it gathers its strength, you know, to just stretch away from the rest of the body. Just goes for it in this plea, you know. It just… [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] “Love me.” [audience laughing] [audience applauding] “Touch me, please.” “Touch me.” “Touching you, touching me.” “Quick, I only have a minute.” [audience laughing] Meanwhile, they try to tell you the vulva is the flower, you know. The vulva is the rose, the petals of the rose. You know, the vulva. I appreciate those comparisons, you know. They’re trying to say that the vulva is beautiful, and I agree, you know. But if someone gave me a bouquet of roses and one of them looked like my vulva, [audience laughing] I’d say, “I think someone stepped on one of the roses.” [audience laughing] It slipped from the bouquet, someone stepped on it. Then they tried to get rid of the evidence by kicking it into a crack in the wall. And it just won’t fully disappear inside there, will it? No. And why are the petals so thick? [audience laughing] No, the vulva… the vulva is beautiful, but it requires the kind of tilted gaze of a more poetic eye. Shall I step in? I mean, I’ll give it a shot. To me, the vulva… my vulva, perhaps, my vulva is beautiful in the way that a tattered flag is beautiful. [audience laughing] Its frayed edges telling a tale of how ideals met actualities. [audience laughing] To me, a vulva may be beautiful in the way a burger is beautiful. A burger with all its particular fixings, you know, wrapped up in crinkly, greasy, foiled paper, and then they cut… I love when they wrap it up and then they cut it. [audience laughing] And then they go… [swishes] Then you see the layers, these different textures and they’re pressed together. And yeah, there’s a threat of a spill. Yeah, there’s a risk of a sudden disassembly. But it holds. It holds. The vulva is the burger that holds. [audience laughing and applauding] The penis is the flower. The penis is… I think the penis is a feminine icon, if I may be so bold. [audience laughing] At very least, it’s the most feminine thing on my boyfriend’s body. Like, if my boyfriend got out of the shower and said, “Quick, find the little woman on this man.” [audience laughing] It’d be an odd game, but I’d instantly have an answer. It’s not the shoulder. [audience laughing] I’d go, “I see her. I see her. She’s right there. Susan.” The name Susan would come to me instantly. His penis is a Susan, but looking back… looking back, they were all Susans to me. They were Susans, they were Geraldines, they were Vanessas. Now, am I saying the penis is a little woman? Well, if you’re a certain kind of guy who really doesn’t like that idea, then yeah, that’s exactly what the fuck I’m saying. [audience laughing] But no, it’s more like… it’s more like the rude stereotypes of women. Those were good descriptions of the penis the whole time. Describe women unfairly, you’re probably describing the penis perfectly, you know. “Oh, they’re so sensitive. They’re always reacting to things.” “They’re needy, they nag you, they poke you in the night.” “Hello. Are you awake?” “I’m awake. I guess we’re both awake now.” [audience laughing] The penis is the sensitive. The penis is the nag. The penis is the drama queen. I mean, the ultimate drama queen. Just one minute, life of the party, and then the very next just flopped over and sulking on the fainting couch… [audience laughing] …that is the inner thigh, just waiting for someone to notice that frankly she’s upset. [audience laughing] Can’t be mad at her, she didn’t make a scene, she just stepped aside. Just left the… I’m not making a face. This is my face. [audience laughing] This is the face you married. [audience laughing] The penis orgasm has kind of a hysterical quality to it… [audience laughing] …in the old sense. A proper turn-of-the-century Vienna Freud’s couch. A proper neurotic hysteric. The orgasm, a kind of sudden revelation, a hideous blurt, as a… “I killed father,” you know. [audience laughing] A little… a little bit of Abigail in the courthouse in The Crucible. And I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil! And now everyone… everyone’s gotta deal with it. A hint… a hint of my mother at a family gathering. Something comes to mind she thinks to say, realizes she shouldn’t. And then there’s a pushing it down, but the only relief for her is for her to just get it out. I see her coming my way, just… [muttering] “Are you sad you don’t have kids?” And it’s on me. [audience laughing] And she feels better, and fair enough. Fair enough. I get her a journal eve',\n",
       "  'ry year for Christmas, but I’m the journal. I’m the journal, and that’s okay. [audience laughing] That’s okay. But no, I feel like my orgasm… my orgasm doesn’t put it on you in that same way. I feel like my orgasm has more of a selfless, heroic, frankly militaristic quality to it. [audience laughing] I feel like my orgasm’s like, “You guys, run, run!” Like, “I’ll throw myself on the grenade and absorb the shock with my body.” [audience laughing] And then at its most, you know, explosive moments of pleasure, the vaginal vulva complex, it doesn’t explode. You know, it holds. [audience laughing] It holds. It embodies the masculine, Stoic, ideal. It just pulses. Doing isometric work, contained and strong. A Viking against a tree after the battle is over. Just pulsing to the rhythm of the battle drums fading away. No, the penis… the penis is clearly the more physically vulnerable of the crotchal items we come across. That’s why I’ve never understood why it doesn’t fully retract into the body… [audience laughing] …after it’s done doing any of the things it does. I always feel like, “Wait. Why can I still see you?” “You’re weak. You need to go home.” “It’s not safe for you out here in that form. You need to retreat.” “Please retreat. Retreat. Retreat.” Sometimes I like to think of it as a puppet at a puppet show. It comes out and does its bit, but after this puppet’s bit is over it doesn’t disappear behind the puppet theater. This puppet just dies over the front of the stage and hangs there lifeless and scaring the children while the show continues, and you’re going, “I feel like we’re not supposed to be able to see that character anymore.” And you’re just hoping someone will just reel it back in or the other puppets will incorporate its death into the narrative. [audience laughing] The penis’s vulnerability is something I’ve been aware of for some time. Really since, I don’t know, age 11 when I started reading these magazines with these articles, headlines on the cover, “How to please your man.” They broke the story every month and I’d flip to the article to see if there was anything new. And it always kind of came down to a list of instructions about how not to injure the tender penis. You know? I remember specifically they said, “Careful near the tip.” “It’s extremely sensitive.” “You… you can’t imagine a part of the body as sensitive as the tip of a penis.” It’s like, “Oh God.” It must be very sensitive then, and that’s the first thing I’m gonna run into on the penis, like in my approach. I have to land gingerly ’cause that’s the most sensitive part? Shouldn’t you bury that treasure somewhere deeper in the castle? [audience laughing] I go, “All right. Once I’m past the gauntlet of the sensitive tip, surely now I can relax.” “I mean, I’m on the shaft, right?” The shaft sounds strong, but no, they had a warning there. They said the underside of the shaft, the skin is thin and delicate. Shall I dab eye cream on it with my weakest finger? [audience laughing] Dab and tap. We’ll need dab and tap. And then the balls, the storied balls. Endless mythology of the balls, the way things can go wrong for them and it’ll be your fault. The blue balls legend, of course. Cross-culturally it can vary, but the essence is always the same, you know. If you’re the cause… if you’re the cause of an erection, well… well, you better answer for that erection you caused. ‘Cause clock’s ticking and pretty soon those balls down there, well, they could turn blue and I’m just… it’s never clear what happens after that. [audience laughing] All that’s clear is that now you’re the witch. You’re the witch. [audience laughing] You’re the witch that turns little balls blue. It’s just never been… it’s never been a sexually-inspiring threat to me. The blue balls threat. You know that kinda, “Oh, somebody might want to do something soon like jerk me off or something, ’cause otherwise it’s really gonna hurt down there. Ooh.” It just turns you into this baby and me into your mama sexually where I have to look out for your potential medical emergency ’cause you know, it takes a village. [audience laughing] No, I… I think it’s the helplessness of blue balls that repulses me. That kinda… you know… the refusal to relieve oneself. If I have a very full bladder, I don’t stand around complaining, “Why isn’t anyone bonking me on the lower abdomen to get the urine out.” Right? I would excuse myself to relieve myself. But blue balls has this kind of… kind of… kind of… “No!” Right? “I don’t do it. No.” “No!” This kind of overtired… “No, I don’t do it… No, only Mama.” [audience laughing] “Only Mama burp my dick.” [audience laughing] It’s a burping of the dick. [chuckles] If blue balls are real, then to relieve them is to burp them. And look, I occasionally overreach with my metaphors, you know, for the love of the game. [audience laughing] Not that one, that one’s perfect. [audience laughing] The teeth-shaming started young. The messages of “Oh, if you have your full set of teeth, don’t you go in a room where a penis is.” “It’s not safe for that penis.” [audience laughing] “Why would you put that penis at risk, you toothy monster?” What’s the idea, what’s the plan? Are you gonna try to give someone a toothy blow job? Is that the idea? The Toothy Blow Job, another tale from Grimms’, I guess. [audience laughing] And somehow kind of a big concept at my high school. The first time I understood this in a practical way that my teeth were a potential danger to the penis, I was 12. I was at my best friend’s house after school. So it was me, it was my best friend, you know, 12, her older sister, 16, and the older sister’s best friend, 16. So the relationship there, you know, is… is over, up, and over and I always feel like Over, Up, and Over is someone you can get real information from. [audience chuckling] I know everything Over knows. Everything Over knows came from Up. Over, Up, and Over? That’s a diagonal… that’s a diagonal wisdom. You go, “Thank God I’m here on this day. It didn’t have to go this way.” But I feel like she knew her role was to teach ’cause she said to us, kinda out of nowhere, “All right, so I guess I’ll show you girls now how to give a blow job because well, you’ll need to know eventually and ’cause I’m the blow job queen.” She just said it. [audience laughing] And she took a cucumber out of the fridge and she wrapped it in cellophane out of respect for dinner, which I appreciated… [audience laughing] …and she began to demonstrate on the cucumber. I don’t know who can learn from a demonstration in this life, I mean, any context, you know, they just do nothing for me. Watching the art teacher paint. It’s just, “Indeed, I… I see why you’re the teacher.” [audience laughing] “You’re very good.” “Shall we proceed to our canvases now so the humiliations can begin.” You know? She’s demonstrating on the cucumber and I’m more stuck on what she said. The “blow job queen” thing. Maybe even more the way she said it, ’cause she just said it, you know, she just let the words ring out in the air. She didn’t make a face to let us know that she knew that she was being a little funny or grandiose. No, she just said it and she launched into her demonstration with authority and I had questions, none of which I asked, to be clear. No, no, I mean the first one being, “According to whom?” But I’m not going to ask that, okay. I’m not going to ask that. I mean, to be clear, I didn’t even blink when she said blow job queen ’cause I think that’s one of the few courtesies we can offer nice people in this life. If they go for it and do the impossible? Say something about themselves with confidence? Jesus, let them have it. I mean, just… [audience laughing] And don’t act like you’re letting them have it but like, also reveal that you’re not letting them have it… Sort of blinking up a storm. No, hold their gaze and let them have it. [audience laughing] It’s a nearly impossible act, you know? I’ll occasionally say my own name and then just go, “Did I get that right?” You know? [audience laughing] The confidence… the confidence required to say something like that. I mean, wow, you know. It felt like it was a proper self-appointment. And that impressed me and that bewildered me. I mean, I’ve always attempted in this life to err towards what feels to me like a sort of prudent self-doubt in favor of the potentially foolish self-confidence, you know. Self-confidence is a good idea, you know. Yeah, but there’s a risk there. There’s a risk there. [audience laughing] I fear that if I’m confident, I may turn into what I think of as The Two Fools. [exhales] Okay, so if I like myself, might feel good. But what if I’m wrong about myself? [chuckling] What are me and myself? We’re just these two fools just congratulating each other. “Oh. Best in the biz.” “No one quite like us. We’re fantastic.” To me, it feels safe, you know, if I stand in the bathroom mirror, to look at that person in the mirror and insult the person in the mirror. Say, “You’re a fool.” That way, even if they are a fool, at least me, on this side of the mirror, I’m someone who can spot a fool. [audience laughing] And then I… I am not, in myself, two fools. I’m a fool and someone who’s well aware. You know? [audience laughing] I’m a fool and someone apologizing for them. And then… and then my duo has 50% dignity. Do you see? I get a guaran… If you split in two and hate yourself, you get a guarantee of 50% dignity, versus taking the gamble of zero versus 100. Do you see… do you see… do you see how… how the math of self-hatred is unimpeachable? [audience laughing and applauding] But the seemingly self-appointed blow job queen, I’ll take it. [laughs] [audience laughing] The seemin',\n",
       "  'gly self-appointed blow job queen said a couple things in her lesson that really stuck with me through the years. The first was just an offhand comment. She goes like this. “Oh, and you can play with the balls if you want,” and… and then never mention them again.” [audience laughing] “If you want.” “You can play with the balls if you want.” I mean, I’m… I’m still thinking about it. [audience laughing] Like you’re gonna be there, you’re gonna be dying to play with those balls, but you won’t know if you’re allowed, and she wanted to let us know that like the toys in the pediatrician’s office… No, please, those are literally there for you. [audience laughing] I mean, if she’d said tickle the balls, if she said tickle the balls, I’d know what to do. That’s a specific action, but to play with something… to play with something? I mean, that’s an intuitive, absent-minded sort of act. I mean, how does one bring an authentic spirit of play… [audience laughing] …to the balls? ‘Cause if there was a hint of cliché to my ball play, I could not live, do you understand? No! A whiff of contrivance. No, it is authentic or not at all for me in this life. That is a principal I’ve stood by since infancy. Really, really, I was one of the most authentic infants on that ward. [audience laughing] It was facade-ville in there, honestly. All these babies. “Oh, look at me, I’m a baby.” Not me. I was just living. [audience laughing] Authentic or not at all, the principle I’ve stood by for better or worse. [chuckling] I could give you endless examples… I could give you endless examples of me choosing authenticity when I feel others did not. I’ll give you one example from childhood, perhaps you’ll see yourself reflected. So they used to make us play this game. They used to make us play this game in gym where you have to dance and the teacher says “freeze.” You gotta freeze in the position you’re in and if you can’t, you’re out. So here’s how I would approach that game with what I believe is authenticity. Would you mind saying freeze for me just after a couple seconds of my dancing? Okay, thank you. All right. Just you, please. Thank you, thank you. All right, this is me playing that game in gym. [man] Freeze! That was an authentic freeze. [audience laughing] You saw. You saw me do my best to freeze in the position I was in. Sometimes… I know it wasn’t particularly exciting, okay? [audience laughing] Sometimes I’d see another kid approach it more like this. Could you do it again for me? All right, thank you. [man] Freeze. [audience laughing] Kids like that disgust me. [audience laughing and applauding] It’s deeply inauthentic. It’s deeply inauthentic. No, that’s not a freeze. That’s not a freeze. You didn’t freeze in the position you were in. No, you did not. No, you did not. And first of all, where were those moves during the dancing part? Nowhere. No, only now that we’re all commonly, boringly, and authentically paused, now you’re the big man. I don’t like it. I don’t like it one bit. I’ll bear witness to the end of my days. I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen. But I tell you this so you know. I tell you this so you understand that I hold myself to this same, cruel standard of authenticity. So I find myself asking, “How would I… how would I play with balls authentically?” [audience laughing] Well, I know what I would do if I had two clementines in a plastic bag, and I was waiting at a bus stop or something. [audience laughing] It’d be a bit of this. Yeah, I wouldn’t even have to think about it. It’d be totally unself-conscious play. I think it’d be going clockwise. Not because I planned it, that’s just sort of what I’d be doing. And I get to a point where I feel the potential energy build, and I go, “Do you think we could get one more revolution in and I do it?” Oh, yeah, yeah. I know it’s time. I know it’s time. And I let it spin back the other way, like, this is what we worked for. [audience laughing] [sighs] Sensational! The spirit soars into the counterclockwise galaxy. But I’m not gonna do that with the balls, no. I… I wouldn’t even spin them a single degree. ‘Cause I think you’d know sorta what I was hoping to do. But I… I don’t believe the impulse is entirely my fault. I do believe that the anatomy of the balls itself is kind of daring us. Like, I do believe that the neck of the bag of the balls, it’s just long enough where its existence is sort of inherently posing the question of could it all spin past 12. [audience laughing] So satisfying if it took even once and came right back. No, I have no play. I have no play for the balls. I’ve overthought it, some would say. I don’t believe in that idea. But I don’t want to look like I’m afraid to touch the balls. Would you… would you like to know what I’ve done when it comes to the balls historically and presently? It’s not… it’s not great. [groaning lightly] I lift them an inch. [audience laughing] It’s a minor elevation, uh, it’s not particularly sexy, but you can’t be mad at me, I mean, I’m helping out. I’m help… I’m helping relieve the bag of the burden of gravity for a couple seconds in this life. And if that’s not worth something, I… I… I don’t know what is. But it feels feeble. I feel like the intern trying to add value, you know? [audience laughing] Without waiting to be asked to do something, that horrible sensation. You want to help, there literally is no way. It’s the same weird sensation I get if I try to help a group of people move something heavy, you know, like a picnic table. I get there just a moment too late. The weight has already been distributed among the other carriers so you’re just sort of running along. You don’t have the weight. There’s no way to take it. Worst part, little jokes on the way. “I think I’m getting off easy today.” “Pretty sure you guys are doing all the work.” [laughs] No, no. I will not partake. No. If that happens to me, if I find myself in that scenario, no, I back away. I say, “And I thank you for what you do, but I will not live this lie.” [audience laughing] It’s the same with the balls for me. I become humiliated by the feebleness of this gesture and I gently lower, and I put my hand away, and that’s where I’ve been for some time now. [audience laughing] The second thing the blow job queen said, arguably this had to be her global philosophy ’cause it’s kind of how she wrapped up the lesson, she goes, “Look, I just want you to know that at the end of the day when it comes to the blow job, you really can’t go wrong…” [audience laughing] “…’Cause the person? They’re just happy to be there.” [audience laughing] Isn’t that beautiful? I loved that. That made sense to me. To me she’s saying, “It’s not technique that matters.” “It’s the spirit of the thing.” That put me at ease. Then she goes, “Well, as long as you don’t bite his dick off.” [laughing sarcastically] And I was like, “Um.” [audience laughing] “Before we move on to another subject, is that real?” “Could I bite a dick off?” And she was like, “You would never bite a dick off.” And I was like, “No, I said could I, could I, bite a dick off?” Like, if that was my goal, do I have the simple machinery necessary? ‘Cause if I “could” bite a dick off then “would” is just one letter away. I mean… [audience laughing] It’s right there, especially if I’m worried about it. If I’m worried about it, then it’s “Don’t bite his dick off. Don’t bite his dick off.” “What’s the thing we don’t wanna do? Bite his dick off. One more time!” “Bite this dick off. Bite this dick off.” [chomps] It’d be right on the beat. That’s how I’d bite a dick off. No, I wanna know if I have what it takes. If you found my skull, my jaw, my teeth, the whole thing, if you found it in a field 200 years from now, you know, could you use that in a pinch as a weapon… [audience laughing] …specifically to bite dicks off? The question… the question was, can these bones… can these bones chomp through the penis’s bone? [audience chuckling] [exhales] And she said something like, “You know there’s no bone in there, right?” And I believe that I knew. [audience laughing] I believe I knew. But would you blame a girl for forgetting for a second? [audience laughing] Would you blame a girl for forgetting that there’s no bone in the penis when she was reared on terms like “boner?” [audience laughing] “Rock-hard boner.” When there is no bone in there, and what is there at its hardest, still not rock-hard. [audience chuckling] [chuckles] Not rock-hard. [audience laughing] No, it’s never been… rock-hard. [audience laughing and applauding] At its hardest, still not rock-hard. No. No. No. Rocks have certain qualities. [audience laughing] I’m no great geologist, but you couldn’t have a penis-paper-scissors game. No one’s playing the penis. It’s not a good substitute for a rock. Can’t take scissors, can’t take paper. It’d be a 50-50 game. Do you see? No one would play. No. To me, linguistically-speaking, a rock is something you get hit by. Like, “Oh God! Oh my God, I think I was just hit by a rock.” Right? A penis, you were slapped, no matter how it happens. [audience laughing] Falls from the sky, it’s a slappy kind of object. [unintelligible speech] Right? A rock is like, “Oh God!” Right? A penis is sort of… [unintelligible speech] [audience laughing] No, it’s like it’s a spirit. It’s a spirit. “Do you feel how hard I am?” “Do you feel how rock-hard this boner is?” And I’m like, “No.” [audience laughing] “No, I don’t.” [laughing] “I know what you mean.” “I recognize the change in your penis you’re referring to, and sure, I’m glad.” But no, if it’s so rock-hard, then why is my tooth such a risk to it? [audience laughing] Shouldn’t I be afraid that my tooth, my little tooth, is gonna get chipped on your ro',\n",
       "  'ck-hard fucking boner? But my dentist isn’t going to believe that story. [audience laughing] No. No. It’s not rock-hard. Picture the rockest-hardest boner you can, indulge me. Okay, take it into a nice restaurant in your mind. Plate it over a pureed celery root. Pour the jus, side of spinach, you know, sprig of parsley. Take a bite, tell me you’re not saying, “Tenderest meat I ever tasted.” Callin’ over the chef. “Chef, it fell right off the bone.” The chef has to remind you, actually there is no bone there. It’s a boneless cut of meat. It’s hard in the way a bag of blood is hard. It’s erectile flesh, much like a nipple. No, it’s not… it’s not rock-hard. It’s not rock-hard. I mean, if I had a pebble in my shoe, you know, I’d probably stop on the side of the street and take off my shoe and shake it out. If had a tiny, rock-hard boner in my shoe, I think I’m just going home. [audience laughing] No. And by the way, the Washington Monument isn’t phallic. It’s not phallic. That thing’s been standing for 175 years. Do you know what a rock never does? Stop being a rock all of a sudden. [audience laughing] I wanna be clear. Maybe it seems I’m being a little literal, you know. I get it, okay. [chuckling] Rock-hard boner. It’s descriptive language. It’s an image. It’s literary language, maybe not our finest, but that’s technically what it is. And I like that sort of thing as much as the next girl. Okay? It’s just that all the language of the penis that’s supposed to make it seem cock-like, you know? Just draws attention back to me to the penis’s very tender nature. The… the rock-hard boner, the… the anaconda, the penis as snake. It’s always compared to a snake. The penis is not a snake. No. I mean, snakes, I’m pretty sure they have sharp senses and at the very least, they’re pretty with it. [audience laughing] I mean, I think they strike with precision, you know. I’ve never not guided a penis anywhere it was headed. [audience laughing] And that’s not a complaint either. I prefer a guided entry. I much prefer a guided entry. I prefer it to the sort of, “Look ma. No hands. I’ll find my way.” You know. [audience laughing] “Don’t help! Don’t help!” [audience laughing] “What if I try the same spot and angle again but now with more force?” “You did it. You did it.” [laughs] “You managed to elbow your way in at some weird angle.” “You dragged half of me inside of me with me.” ‘Cause it’s like taking the arm out of a coat and the sleeve got pulled along too. [audience laughing] Now I have to spend a minute working that out, getting things back on track while acting like I’m not getting things on track. [chuckling] Trying to line up the silky interiors, not the woolen exteriors. I think the word penetrate’s a bit much for what happens between a penis and me. Every time you penetrate, you penetrate, you penetrate enemy territory. No, you’re a guest in my home. I invited you in, and I made it quite pleasant for you. [audience laughing] No, you know if you look up “penetrate” in the dictionary, or my favorite dictionary, the thesaurus… [moans] I love the thesaurus. I love the way it gets right to it with those other words. [audience laughing] Yeah, none of them are perfect, but there they are. The people’s dictionary, I always say. [audience laughing] The first synonym for “penetrate” is “puncture,” but you didn’t puncture anything here. This is a working passageway and it’s been one for some time. You missed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. We’ve been operational for a while now. And I’m not saying it’s this grand open entrance that you could sort of amble on in. No. No. The walls of this vaginal canal lie flat, indeed they do. [moans] Okay. But the walls of a glove lie flat. And when you put your hand into a glove, you don’t say, “I penetrated that glove.” You put your gloves on and you don’t even talk about it. [audience laughing] If you don’t like penetrate, like I don’t, your next option, “Enter.” Oh, the more literary “to enter someone,” you know like, “Oh, oh, the moment.” “Oh, the very moment that you entered me, my world changed and me along with it.” No, I’ve never been entered. [chuckles] [audience laughing] No, I think it’s a matter of scale for me, you know? Like, uh… like, um… You know, if my body was a building. If my body was like a store, like a Target, and someone did the equivalent of what entering me is into Target, I don’t think they’re even passed those second glass doors. [audience laughing] I don’t think they can really say they went to Target today. [audience laughing] No, I think they loitered in the entryway. They made those doors open and close and open and close primarily. They were a problem in the parking lot outside Target today. “Penetrate.” “Enter me.” “Laid pipe in her.” I heard that for the first time in college. “I laid pipe in her” and the penis is supposed to be the pipe. Here, young man? And you’re the plumber? You’ve plumbed nothing in this life. I know that. You’re an Econ major and I’ve hated you for some time. [audience laughing and applauding] “Choke on it, bitch.” “Uh, choke on… choke on this dick. Choke on this fat dick.” “Let’s hear you choke and make the choke… [vocalizes]” Is that what you want? The look of fear and panic in my eye? [vocalizing] I’ve always been afraid of choking, one of my main fears. Never on the penis. No, never been afraid of choking on the penis ’cause it’s not a choking hazard, it’s attached. [audience laughing] I’m choking on it. I’m choking on it. I’m choking on that dick. Oh wait. [audience laughing and applauding] I’m completely safe. [audience laughing] Death is here. Ooh, death is here. Gonna try to live a long life if I take care of myself properly and make a few good decisions. No. You know what? No one would ever deep throat a gumball. No one would gargle a gumball in the back of their throat. That’s a real risk. No. No. A child’s gumball is more of a threat than the cock. Do you see? [audience laughing] I wasn’t always this way. [audience laughing] [chuckles] Okay. You know this whole, “Your cock ain’t shit.” [laughing sarcastically] No. No, you don’t start out this way and then feel the need to do this, okay. [audience laughing] No, I used to be afraid. [audience chuckling] Like, the first time that I tried to give a blow job, for example, I failed miserably. I backed out at the last possible second before doing it ’cause I realized the essential problem with the thing and it was perfect circumstances too. Really. I was 16 and I had a boyfriend a grade above me. You know, I had the boyfriend laid out on a bed like a patient etherized upon a table his body a slow-moving fog, I guess. I’ve got him on this bed in someone’s guest room, someone’s finished basement. Oh, and I love the smell of a newly-finished basement, you know. The off-gassing of the fresh rug. The feeling the family’s doing it. They finished the basement, what’s next, the deck? Oh God. I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine but I know it’s going to be so goddamn beautiful. [audience laughing] So I’ve got him on this bed in this guest room in this finished basement. Someone’s party’s going on upstairs. Someone’s parents not home. So many layers between me and the boyfriend. You know, and my own home, my own parents. I mean, this is as close as you can get to attempting a blow job in a vacuum. [audience laughing] So I make my way, you know, down the torso. [audience laughing] And all that that entails, you know, the whole… [exhales] …the whole, “Can she do it?” [audience laughing] The uncertainty, the whole thing. And maybe I took it too slowly, too humbly, not enough speed, momentum, confidence, but when I get there, I am hesitating. I am not doing it. I… [sighs] …I’m hovering even. [humming] [audience laughing] And it’s a bummer ’cause I really want to do it. And some would say, “You didn’t really want to do it in the sense of desire or you’d just be doing it.” No, I mean, yeah. [chuckles] I’ve never hovered over a French fry. That is true. [audience laughing] The second I recognize the desire, I collapse the desire through the consumption of the fry, but I did want to do it. I wanted to do it, and that’s real too. You have to understand at this time in my life I get dropped off at Borders bookstore quite a bit. [audience laughing] I’d stay there for hours and I’d read all sorts of things, you know, including these quote books, these compilations of quotations. I’d sort of lock my knees and speed-read the quote books to try to get the wisdom of the ages. When you speed-read those books, certain themes emerge, a big one “Youth is wasted on the young.” And I hear you, voices of the past. I’m not gonna do that. No. I’m gonna drink cum. I’m gonna drink cum in the July grass, under the moonlight, and I’m gonna do it as soon as I can. I mean, that’s what Borders teaches you. [audience laughing] If you’re a young, voracious reader, there’s so much passion in those pages. So many lives lived, you know, and the feeling that my life can only be one book at most. So I wanna get started on that life. But I’m there. I’m there and I’m not getting started on it, you know. And why? Why? Is it ’cause I feel all alone before the awesomeness of this great task? You know? Not really. I actually feel the full support of the entire field hockey team behind me on this one. ‘Cause they had driven me to this party on this night to give this specific blow job. [audience laughing] Earlier that night I was at a team-spirit-building sleepover with the entire team, and the older girls who are friends with my older boyfriend, I guess they were looking out, you know, for him and me, in a way. [audience laughing] And they said, like, “We understand you haven’t given him a ',\n",
       "  'blow job yet.” You know, like, “Why? [chuckles] Is it ’cause you’re afraid?” “You don’t have to be afraid. It’s a… It’s a ‘Just do it’ kind of thing.” “You just do it and then you’ll have done it and that will be it. 3, 2, 1, fake until you make it, just do it…” “That’s wonderful advice,” I said. You know, “Thank you.” “Next time I see him, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll just do it.” They were like, “But next time can be now. He’s only five minutes away by car.” “And we have a car. Here’s a beer.” I could barely get four sips of the beer down, I’m a cocktail woman. I didn’t know that yet. [audience laughing] And they got me out to the car and they chanted, “Blow him.” “Blow him. Blow him. Blow him.” Maybe it sounds like peer pressure to some. [audience laughing] I didn’t experience it as such. No, I experienced their pressure as support you see, because I was a young Tony Robbins reader. [audience laughing] So I knew if you tell people your goals, you become more likely to achieve them. You… you feel accountable. Do you see? I had done the Personal Power series in sixth grade, uh, the 48 cassette tapes. Bit of a close read of Awaken the Giant Within in seventh, and now in high school, I was revisiting Giant to prepare for PSATs. I know, you can’t prepare for the PSATs. No, but you can dismantle the limiting beliefs that get you a negative headspace, which can affect where you land in your general scoring territory, so… [audience laughing and applauding] The team captain drives me over to the party where my boyfriend is and on the way, you know, tries to level with me, like, “So really, why haven’t you done it?” “Like why haven’t you given your boyfriend a blow job?” And I was like, “Well, primarily I’m worried about the teeth.” “I don’t understand where they’re gonna go. They’re everywhere.” [audience laughing] “And you know, there’s no bone in there?” and she already knew. [audience laughing] She’s like, “You don’t have to worry about the teeth ’cause the way you give the blow job is you lubricate around the mouth, nose down, grease it up with lip balm or Vaseline or anything of your choosing, and then you wrap each lip around each corresponding row of teeth, under, over and then you smile.” “To pull it taut, so…” [audience laughing] “And then it safely slides, you see. Keep smiling.” Some of you are thinking, “Indeed.” [audience laughing] “Yeah, Sweetie, we know what a blow job is. Carry on.” You know. I don’t know. It could be 5% of you. It could be 95% of you. There are… there are no rules, but… When she said it, she was like, “You get it? You get it?” And I was like, “Yes. Thank you, you solved it.” And she had. But it was like when someone gives you bad directions. You’re pretty sure they’re wrong, but you feel you gotta wait till they’re out of view before you ask someone else, you know, ’cause you had a thing, you had rapport. And so it’s just, you know you’re polite and still alone on the side of the road… [audience laughing] [sighs] Something in me when she said that… You know, something in me said that… that… [audience chuckling] That can’t be it. [audience laughing] This greased up Muppet. That… [audience laughing and applauding] That can’t be what a blow job is, you know. For the blow job to be a thing at all, for it to have its own title, you know, for it to have endured through the ages, and for someone to have invented it in the first place spontaneously in the woods like some bloated-heart cave person who felt this passion the other moves just weren’t freshly expressing, you know. And then they improvised. Like, “What’s the craziest…” Like, “Wait, wait!” “What’s the craziest thing I can do to you?” They thought about it… and then they knew. You know, like, “Ah!” And they knew what they had, you know. And it’s like the windowed envelope. It’s a simple, but elegant solution. Could you have thought of it? You know what I’m talking about? Address, you put it on the letter, then you put it in an envelope. You don’t have to put the address ’cause there’s a window in it. Before someone thought of that, no one thought of that. [audience laughing] To me, it’s the same with a blow job. I mean, just… “What’s the craziest thing I could do to you?” “How could I express the intensity of…?” And then they knew what they had. And it was a risk, but they went for it. You know, they just… [moaning progressively louder] [audience laughing] That kind of genius, I mean, it cannot be overstated. It just seemed to me like for the blow job to have come about spontaneously, it shouldn’t require these… these clever work-arounds, you know. These little hacks and the wasting of my kiwi Body Shop lip balm, you know. It seemed like it should just have a way it just works. An internal poetry to it. You know, I wanna do it like that. Like I was inventing it. Like there was no word for it yet. Real pre-printing press kind of dignity. Authentic. Authentic or not at all, you know? But I’m there, and I’m not doing it. And this is when I realize the essential problem of the thing. It’s those first couple moments, I’m not going to be doing it well. Of course, I’d never done it before. Fair enough. That’s not the problem. The problem is that in those moments when I’m doing it badly, I won’t be able to articulate to the person that I know that I’m doing it badly. [audience laughing] Because my mouth is stuffed full of genitals. Do you see… do you see? The blow job precludes your ability to narrate, to explain yourself, to provide context, to make a little joke. There’s no way to communicate awareness. And it’s always about communicating awareness for me. You know, I don’t actually mind being a fool in this life, you know. As long as I can let you know that I, too, hear the jangle of the bells upon my hat. [audience laughing and applauding] [cheering] Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. Indeed, I hear them too. “You’d never believe this, I sewed those in.” I make my own costumes, and I thought they might be interesting.” [audience laughing] No, if I had a second mouth in this scenario, I’d be aces. I mean, this’d be nothing. It’d be one mouth to attempt the blow job and a second one to go, “Okay. Hold on.” “Obviously, this is not a blow job yet.” “I’m just trying to get in a position where I… wow.” “My tooth has already dragged. Obviously you felt that.” “I just want to let you know that we’re aware of the problem and we are working on a solution, and we so greatly appreciate your patience on this day.” But no. No. You have no words, all you have is dumb eyes. Just the… [audience laughing] Just the dumb eyes of someone figuring something out. Just that stupid learning-on-the-job look. I hate that look. No dignity in it, just concentration. You know, earnest attempts at adjusting in the moment to surprise. No. No. No. No dignity. No. No words, no dignity. No words, I see no way through, and so I don’t know what to do. So I just start backing my way, you know, just back up the torso as humbly and feebly as I had gone, and I… I get back to the face and I was like, I wanna do something, I mean, my team is counting on me. [audience chuckling] And Borders. Above all, Borders, you know. I want to… I want to get started on this life. And so I take a deep breath… [inhales] …and relax ’cause that’s the thing. You relax and the answer is supposed to appear and for once it did. My virginity, I gave it to him. [audience laughing and applauding] Process that however you need. Okay, but for me, it was genius. For me, it was genius. Absolutely genius. ‘Cause I never valued my virginity. Why would I? I’m a self-starter, and I had gotten that just for showing up on Earth. I hadn’t earned it. No. To me, virginity always felt like the house’s money. [audience laughing] I got this virginity here, I think we’re supposed to spend it. It’s almost like, like a voucher. Like, two vouchers in a gift bag in a hotel room, like, “They put two virginity vouchers in here.” I mean, people make a big deal about this, but I don’t really give a shit. But for a goof, we should probably try to use it before we leave the resort. I wasn’t worried about saving myself, you know, my… myself for marriage. If my… myself, referred to my fear and discomfort around my body and yours. For you, true love. No. If I was gonna present something to the eventual true love, I’d want it to be a collection of sexual skills and an attitude of confidence, you know, with which to employ them. A sort of idiosyncratic lexicon to express my idiosyncratic yet universal love. But in order to gain those skills, I’d have to have a variety of lesser experiences. That’s just how it goes. I’d have to have my training montage. [audience laughing] Then I can set it aside. Then like the moody prince renouncing his wealth, you know, I could set that aside and then eventually for the true love on my wedding day, you know, my father could present that, you know, on behalf of the family. “From our family to yours.” “I don’t know what to say, but I know she worked really hard on this.” [audience laughing] I wasn’t worried about purity, the idea that with every sexual experience, uh, you’re a little more diminished. That sort of the scratch-and-sniff sticker model of personhood. You know, kinda, “Oh, little scratch here, little sniff there.” “It’s a good time, sure, isn’t it? But yeah, yeah, pretty soon, what are you?” “You’re a faded strawberry in sunglasses. Is that what you want?” What do we do with you then, move you to the back of the sticker book with your slut sisters? Oh, we all remember what happened to your eldest sister, beautiful root beer float with feet. [audience laughing] Tried to put her out to pasture. She died under a man’s boot. She didn’t have a s',\n",
       "  \"tink left on her. No sniff on her, no stink on her, just slipped right out, rolled right up… You ever see a sticker roll up on itself? [audience laughing] No, I was ready… I was ready to be a sexually-active teen. And sex, technically-speaking, I mean, it solved a problem, you know? Do you like dry humping but are tired of being injured by the seam of your jeans? [audience laughing] I was ready to be a sexually-active, gum-chewing teen doing the Health teacher proud, you know. And she was proud, and I sensed it. I felt pretty good about it. I also remember sensing the pride of my boyfriend’s father at the time. [chuckles] [audience laughing] Yeah, I think the son had told the father, and there was a notable spring in the man’s step on behalf of his son. Yeah. It’s disgusting. And maybe that’s just ’cause I don’t love a boyfriend’s father, you know, as a figure in general. I think they’re wrong and shouldn’t exist. [audience laughing] But particularly in high school, you know. Even when they’re lovely, it’s the role itself, you know. It’s not even their fault. “Oh, hello.” “Hello, Jacqueline, how are you?” You know, “How’s school?” And it’s just like, “Don’t fucking look at me or talk to me, sir.” “Please, honestly, it’s not a good look for you.” [audience laughing] You know, “Your son gained access to me, your son gained access to me through his own merits.” “You’re owed nothing here.” Not a wave hello. Not a whiff on the side. I think it would be best for all of us if when you heard my car coming down the road, you made yourself scarce. [audience laughing] You went to your little shed and did whatever the hell it is you do in that hideous little shed of yours. If I seem deranged… if I seem deranged in my anger at the boyfriend’s father, it’s ’cause he was a particular kind of asshole. He wasn’t unlike many adults at that time in my life. He would comment a lot on my use of the word “like.” He was obsessed. You know, just like… “Sorry, Jacqueline. It’s just that when you talk, all I hear is the word ‘like.'” “It’s all I can focus on. You know and it’s just…” [groans] That’s all you can hear? That… that’s all you can focus on? Then let me be a cognitive exercise for you, sir, in your fight against mental decline. [audience laughing and applauding] It’s the same word over and over again. Block it out, make it white noise. Selectively ignoring information is one of six basic cognitive skills. I see you doing your little puzzles. Perhaps add “listening to me talk” to the mix if you refuse to go to your shed as I directed earlier. [audience laughing and applauding] Oh, it was really gross, it was really gross ’cause he acted like he cared, you know, in this way, like, he’d be like, “No, it’s just that…” “No, Jacqueline, it’s just that when you use that word so much, you… you dilute the meanings of these things you seem to be trying to say.” “You sound unintelligent.” And it’s rich coming from a man who, looking back, never once said a single thing that caused me to sort of stir with the recognition of original thought. [audience laughing] He was concerned about the potency of my speech. No. No, sir. No. You have not understood at all. No. My intellect is a river, okay? It’s a river and the word “like” is a stone, and I drop stones into that river to break up the current so you’re not swept the fuck under and drowned. [audience cheering and applauding] I say “like” as a courtesy to men like you… [audience laughing] …because you couldn’t handle me. [softly] Precise. [audience laughing] And I know you’re real proud of your son for fucking me, but I’m fucking him, that’s the way that’s going down. He’s not entering me. I’m closing down around him. [audience laughing] He doesn’t penetrate me. I eat him. [audience laughing] I chew him up and I spit him out diminished, and he loves every goddamn second of it. Just like you would, you pig. [audience laughing] You pig in shorts. [audience laughing] I didn’t… I didn’t say shit to the father, to be clear. I could never… I could never do that to a man. I mean, imagine his face. He would’ve been destroyed. I mean, the way he would have crumbled. No, I could never. I could never. But his son was never to know a blow job from me. That’s something, I think. I mean, it wasn’t the father’s fault, to be clear. I just… I… I couldn’t try again with this boyfriend, you know, ’cause he had seen me attempt it once and then retreat in fear. So now if I were to just go for it again, it would have too much of the quality of someone going for it again, you know. “Oh, nerves got her yesterday.” Like the Olympic skater. “Let’s see. Can she land her jumps today?” You know? No, there’s too much awareness. No. I felt like my only option for dignity was to wait out the year, never mention the failed attempt, and then at the end of the summer send that boyfriend off to college so I could start my senior year fresh. That’s what I did, top of my senior year. You know. I scooped up a new boyfriend ’cause I knew that I just… [sighs] In order to be a new person, I kind of needed a new person to be one in front of. [audience laughing] So top of my senior year, I scoop up this new boyfriend and I get him into my parent’s basement, and my parent’s basement is an unfinished basement. So it all feels real, raw, and right, you know? And I decide I’m gonna give him a blow job on the first night we hang out, before he knows me well enough to know my faces, to be able to discern the difference between a mask of confidence and actual real confidence. It’s… it’s a sexual running start, you know? It’s speed. It’s momentum. It’s… it’s about embodying the spirit of the cave person. Like I’m trying to act like I don’t even understand what clothes are. There’s just something in the way of my mouth’s pure desire, even though in my head, I’m like, “Abercrombie. Abercrombie. Abercrombie.” [audience laughing] And it’s kind of a literal running start too ’cause I wanna come from around the basement stairs. Already going for it! You know, it’s that old trick. The blow job starts behind the stairs so they don’t see you wind up. The point is you would’ve been proud. You would’ve been proud. It’s just going, “Ah, ah,” right? And I go, like, “Ah, ah,” and I can tell he’s buying it, you know? And I go, “Ah,” and just right before doing it, I just go, “Oh my God. Look who’s not hesitating.” “Let’s take a moment to say look who’s not hesitating.” And it was just, I don’t know why, I just… “Ah.” And then, you know… and… [chuckles] I was at a dead stop yet again. I… I couldn’t believe it. I mean, just… [humming] Again. This is why I don’t trust the running starts in this life. Do you understand? They don’t carry you through. You have to keep running. I mean… This is why I don’t trust the confident entrances. You know, I know you people deserve something at the top of the show, put you at ease, you know? “What’s up, Town Hall?” “What’s up, New York? Get on your fucking feet.” “I’m the fuckin’ greatest, let you know you’re in good hands.” No. No. You see… “Ah, ah.” And then you see it crack. You see it crack, and decay over the course of the show. [audience chuckling] I’d rather build from nothing. I’d rather just get pushed out, like “Hello? I don’t deserve to live…” You know, “May I have a single breath?” [inhales] “Thank you. That should hold me for a little while.” [audience laughing] I don’t know why I thought the running start thing would work for me. It’s not who I am. You know? I’m someone that’s gone to the end of a diving board and sort of… and sort of… three, two, one, and then pulled it back impossibly at the last second. [audience laughing] You know, just with a move infinitely more complex than the original dive. And it’s just, “Lifeguard. Clear the ladder, I’m coming down.” “Help me out, lifeguard.” I’ve cleared 1,000 ladders in my day. It’s who I am. There’s something in me that knows that in this life, it is almost never… it is almost never too late to turn back. [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] But I’m there. And I’m like, really? Really, we’re hesitating again? What’s the plan here, sweetheart? What… what are you gonna do? Are you gonna back your ass up another goddamn torso? Wait out another year so you can try again next year? On a new person to be a new person in front of in college on unfamiliar territory? No, no, you need to just do it. Well, you’re not a ‘just do it’ person. Do you listen to yourself? I don’t care. I don’t care if you’re an overthinker who wishes she had a second mouth to narrate her every experience. Everyone’ll know I know she knows. It’s about jingle, jangle in this life. Awareness! Aware… No, you need to find the way. Well, Nietzsche said there is no way, there’s only my way. Then find Nietzsche’s way. Then find your way. I have to find a way. So, I… I turned to literature. I, uh… [audience laughing] I was reading Lolita at the time. It is what it is. And I was very taken with the language of Vladimir Nabokov. I mean, who… who wouldn’t be, you know? I’ll admit, I was probably reading it in a slightly performative fashion. I was reading it, to be clear, every word, but I did most enjoy reading it in the windows of pizza shops in my field hockey kilt, you know. Just cover visible, daring adults that walk by to be shocked, you know, just, “I’m sorry. Are you working through the Russian greats?” “I doubt it, you suburban hogs.” [audience laughing and applauding] But I’m there. I’m there, and it’s the same old concerns. You know, no words. No dignity. Looking stupid, sounding stupid, dragging a tooth, all of it, and I go, “All right, all right, “I can’t narrate.” “But what if I imagine someone else is? What if I imagine Vlad\",\n",
       "  'imir Nabokov is?” “What if I imagine this isn’t real,” you know, “this is just a…” [sighs] “I’m just a character in a short story written by Vladimir Nabokov, then no matter how badly this attempt at a blow job goes, I mean, in Nabokov’s deft pen, would the prose not sparkle?” I mean, isn’t it all literature in a way? Isn’t it all text upon text upon text, you know? [groans] And in literature, things can’t go badly. They can only be interesting. The ways that go badly are just the interesting details that bring textures to the story, and I go, “What if the worst happens? What if that happens?” “Don’t get ahead of yourself. What if that happens?” “What if you bite this dick clean off?” [audience laughing] I go, “Well then, you’re likely living inside of the most iconic story in the collection.” “The one where she bites the dick off.” And so I go, “It’s not real. It’s literature.” “It’s all text in the end. Oh.” “Moonlight,” it’s not my finest. “Moonlight.” Start with the moon, yo. “Moonlight streams in on the south face of a young man’s penis.” “A girl with brown hair with red undertones that often go unnoticed…” [audience laughing] “…fumbles her way onto the simple cylinder…” [muffled] …penis… It’s not real… [muffled narration continues] …an American citizen… [muffled narration continues] [audience laughing] And then I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m on that dick! [audience applauding and cheering] Thank you. [chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. Uh, I know it might have sounded a little close to dissociation for some of you there for a minute. Not what we want for our girls. Okay, “Oh, things don’t happen to me. They happen to her, of course. Who? Her.” When things get hairy in my life, I go to a little room in my brain. I might live very small, I watch a tiny television. Only droll things. Oh, yes. Sometimes the little screen tries to show me what’s happening to me in my real and hideous life. I feel for the clicker, and I… No, this was not dissociation. No, this… this was me with an idea. This was transcendence of the ego. Oh. There’s a difference, and it got me on that dick, and I was cooking. I was really cooking. There were no screams of pain. It seemed to just have an internal poetry to it. Like I always thought it should, you know? [exhales] And before I knew it, he ejaculated semen into my mouth as they say, you know the expression. [audience laughing] And I swallowed it ’cause I’m a Tony Robbins reader, and I don’t cut corners. [audience applauding and cheering] Now I always knew. I always knew I’d swallow it. That… that was never a point of neuroses. I knew there was an easy way, a difficult way. I’m gonna default to the difficult way to pick up points. I’m a sort of 3.7-in-the-AP-course-load kind of gal. Not a 4.0 in a lesser class, so yeah. Yeah, I’m gonna swallow it and let the chips fall where they do, and it was a triumph. I mean, it was a goddamn triumph. I wanted to write my college essay about it, but I knew they couldn’t handle it. [audience laughing] They didn’t have the sophistication. No, not the guidance counselors, not the deans, not one of them. Not like you people. [audience laughing] But I knew… I knew what I had done, and I went off to college, you know, feeling pretty good about myself. And it was interesting because it was a sort of Catholic-ish college. At the very least, there were a lot of Catholic virgin boys in neckties sort of scurrying about the place, scrambling for sexual experience at parties. You know, very crass, not me. I had done the coursework in high school. [audience chuckling] And I’m a Jew, so if anything I felt like a kind of Philip Roth figure among them. I felt like a Jewish pervert ready to teach. [audience laughing] Sensational if you can pull it off. I highly recommend. But at this time, I was really in no hurry to blow anyone. To me, the blow job, it was just a conquered thing, you know. It was an art form I… I had mastered in a basic way, I had a working definition of, and now I can think about how I might eventually wanna meaningfully subvert that art form. I was… I was asking big questions like, “What… what can the blow job mean?” You know, “Can the blow job be a love letter… [audience chuckling] …if there’s enough love behind it?” “Can the blow job be a poem? My body, a crude but ecstatic language.” I was in a lot of philosophy classes, and it was all very post-modern and inspiring. And at this time when I eventually came across someone I really liked, a French fry, so to speak… [audience laughing] I blew them, I mean, I simply blew them. Do you see? Not right away, but pretty quickly. [audience laughing] I mean, why wouldn’t I? Do you see, this was what all the work was for. It was as effortless as eating a fry. My lexicon was ready. This was my symphony and my symphony played beautifully. [pants] Was there a let-down after? I don’t know. I wasn’t expecting a marriage proposal. I wouldn’t have been shocked by one. [audience laughing] But I wasn’t expecting one. No. Can a blow job be a love letter? Yes, yes, it can. It doesn’t mean that they’ll love you back and that’s okay ’cause we know. We know, we know, as artists, we’re only entitled to our labor, not the fruits of our labor. Yeah, I think what bummed me out at the time was more the sort of, um, prevailing council of friends, you know. There was this sort of prevailing idea, this sort of, “Well, you know, you’re a modern gal so have your fun here and there of course, but if you really like someone, oh, ‘You really like this one, ‘ you said… [whispering] …then you take it slow.” You know? “Oh. Take it slow.” [audience laughing] “Good to be not too available.” [muffled] “Take it slow… Then you hook…” Ew. [audience laughing] Ew. Ew, no. No, I will not take it slow. No. The hubris astonishes. Death is coming. [audience laughing] Death is coming. And you gotta try to forget to get through the day. You gotta think of yourself as the lead actor in the television series of your life. You’re gonna go, “They’re not killing off my character anytime soon. I’m in…” “I’m in every scene. I think we’re good here.” But what if you’re not the lead actor? I mean, there are other characters. What if you’re not even in the show? What if you’re Steven Tanzer? That’s an actor friend of mine. Very unsuccessful. [audience laughing] Almost no roles. [audience chuckling] It’s the darkest line in the show. [audience laughing] And it’s not a real man’s name, okay? I would never do that to a man. I could never do… But in some ways, it’s worse, ’cause I conjure Steven Tanzer nightly only to destroy him. He lives and dies but to serve as a single illustrative detail in my narrative argument. A fate I wish on few. [chuckles] But death is coming and I have this idea. I have this idea as you know that you shed the form, you shed the flesh and the indignities are left behind with it, but I’m not so sure the embarrassments don’t continue. Why wouldn’t they, you know. I know… I know that I feel embarrassment for certain dead relatives of mine. And really most of them. You know, when I look at photos of them, beautiful photos in beautiful frames, I mean, I’m talking about the real piano toppers in my parent’s home, I look at these photos of them and I can’t shake it, they look dumb to me. They look foolish ’cause I can see in their eyes that in the photo, they don’t realize that they’re dead now. [audience laughing] They look like suckers. I just wanna go, “You’re dead. You’re dead. You’re dead.” You know? [audience laughing] All you gotta do… all you gotta do is try when someone takes a photo of you to just give a hint of a knowing glance. I mean, something, just… [audience laughing and applauding] Just something that, should you die, you know, and someone looks at a photo, they can tell you know whence you stare, and “I’m coming to collect you one of these days.” So I’m in college… I’m in college, and I’m very aware that death is coming. I’m no spring chicken. So I feel like if I have love to give and this eloquent blow job with which to express it, I’m going to. And I do, and I stand by it. But then I go home for a winter break and I run into the old blow job triumph boyfriend from my senior year, and you know we go to the diner so we can eat eggs at night and uh… [audience laughing] …you know, drink our coffee black now. We don’t need this container of sugar packets. “Oh, it stays on the table? Fair enough. I don’t know why as we won’t be using it.” [audience laughing] “We drink our coffee black now.” But we’re talking now, we’re talking like old army buddies. [chuckling] It’s been however many months since graduation, but we’re just talking with this grand perspective, so naturally I’m telling him about the latest guy that I really like at school, and I say something to the old blow job boyfriend, like, “Yeah, I just can’t tell if this guy I like likes me quite as much as I like him.” And the old blowjob boyfriend goes, “Well, maybe he’s intimidated by you.” “Yeah, like I was.” “Still am in some ways.” [audience chuckling] “Never really relaxed around you our entire relationship senior year ever since that first night we hung out when you just randomly blew me.” [audience laughing and applauding] “It was just so random.” “The way you just blew me, blew me.” “It was just… random house.” [audience laughing] “It was Penguin Random House, the way you just blew me, blew me.” Kept hitting the “B.” Blew me. Blew me. I was like, “Oh God.” Like… like, what did I become? Like, through my fear, I was blinded to the prospect that I, too, can make another afraid, and this is how the cycle continues. [audience laughing] But then I was like, “Wait, no. Excuse me, how rude.” “No. Like, you’re not',\n",
       "  ' the innocent, afraid one in this story.” “I’m the innocent, afraid one in this story who was conquering a fear on this day.” “Like, how dare you rob me of my origin story here?” “Like, how dare you try to turn me into the scary, slut villain, you know.” No. No, I was intimidating on that day perhaps but… but… but only in the way Batman’s intimidating, you know. You know, yes, Batman’s intimidating, but how dare you. How dare you look at Batman and not remember that Batman’s only Batman ’cause Batman was a little boy whose parents were killed brutally outside that theater. And the bats flew by, so he was afraid of bats. He had to go be in the cave among the bats to emerge as Batman. So if you see a Batman, there’s a fear of bats that preceded it. If you see a strength, there’s a fear that’s been turned inside out. Overcompensation. Same story 1,000 times. How dare you not see the little boy in me? And he didn’t get it, and fair enough, you know. [audience laughing] I was imprecise, I guess. And he’s one of these people who doesn’t appreciate when you get up and demonstrate something in a restaurant. [chuckles] [audience laughing] That’s pretty much an essential part of my personality. [audience laughing] No one minds. Little treat for the other tables, I always say. [audience laughing] But he said something, he goes… he goes, “I don’t know, Jac.” And he shortened my name to Jac, you know, just to really stick it to me. He just knows me, loves me, cares about me. You know? Oh, he cares. He cares about Jac. He cares about his Jac. “How’s that sweatshirt treating you? Keep it.” You know. [audience laughing] “I don’t know, Jac.” “Maybe a blow job’s just not the way to tell someone you like them.” [sighing] And I was like, “I feel like with me, maybe it can be?” [audience laughing] I still believed, you know. But I was a little freaked out… a little freaked out walking away from that meal ’cause what he was describing was pretty much exactly what I’d been up to at the university for some time now. And I started to wonder if perhaps my poetic blow jobs had not been received with the level of nuance that I was intending them. And I went back to school just a broken Philip Roth. I mean, no swagger. Batman’s gone. I don’t know what to do with myself other than walk around campus just being cold, just cutting a lot of diagonals across various quads, asking myself sad questions. “Does your poetry not hold water?” You know. “Do we not get to make our own meanings in this life?” “Are you just the slut who thought the rules somehow didn’t apply to her?” And I could’ve put my arms through the sleeves of my North Face fleece, you know, but why… why, when you can just Éponine your way around the place? [audience laughing] And eventually I go, “No, we’re not doing that. We’re not gonna do that.” “We’re not gonna be sad about this,” and I shook it off and I forced a chuckle until it felt natural. Like, “No. Ha. No. Look at you. Ha. Look at you.” “Look at you. You set out to conqueror a fear, and you did.” “You give a confident blow job.” “Just like you always wanted to.” [audience laughing] “A blow job so confident, it terrifies men.” [audience laughing] And yeah, it’s lonely at the top. [audience laughing and applauding] [chuckles] But isn’t that just the cost of excellence? Indeed it is. I join a long, lonely line of tragic figures of excellence. And would I have it any other way? No, no. I’ll take superhero and I gather… I gather my fleece and I try to force it to ripple in an all-too-absent breeze. [audience chuckling] But I know who I am. So several years later, I’m in my twenties and I’m in yet another Borders bookstore with yet another boyfriend ’cause would you believe it, they keep on coming. [audience laughing] And as usual, I will give no distinguishing characteristics to the latest boyfriend character ’cause clearly in the end they’re all just these containers for my self-discovery, so… What, you want a quirky detail? We’re not doing those. “Oh, he tugs on his zipper when he’s nervous.” “He smelled like books and cigarettes.” No. No, they got the blow jobs. I think that’s enough. [audience laughing] They don’t also get to be well-illustrated by me here tonight, but I tell you so you know, it’s the final male character for you to conjure and hold separate from the others in your head for just a little bit longer, so… I’m in a bookstore in my twenties with this latest boyfriend and I get a little wistful in a bookshop. I can’t help it, you know. I’m flipping through the Sharon Olds. I’m contemplating my girlhood journey. I’m marveling misty-eyed at the whole thing, and so I tell the latest boyfriend the entire story I’ve told you. [audience laughing] And I cry a little. Um… Just ’cause frankly no one moves me quite like me, I guess. [audience laughing and applauding] First I’m moved then I’m moved by the very depth of my own capacity to be moved. It sort of goes from there. He’s not crying, which… fair enough, I get it. Everyone expresses emotion differently. But I wonder if he’s truly hearing me. I say something like, “I just feel like perhaps you take for granted my perfect blow jobs as this given, this crass fact.” Like, “Sure, my girlfriend gives good head.” “But no, that power was hard-won and with that comes great responsibility, which I continue to negotiate to date.” “Did you hear the Batman part? It was imprecise, but there was a spirit…” I kept talking at his face ’cause his face looked weird. [audience laughing] Something was amiss and finally, I get up the courage to just stop talking and say, “What?” And he goes like this, he goes like this, he goes, “No, it’s just funny ’cause you give kind of a toothy blow job.” [audience laughing] [sighs] Oh, I can barely look at you people just quite yet. [audience chuckling] Me. [audience chuckling] [exhales] Me. [audience chuckling] No one was more worried about the teeth than me. [audience laughing] The Greeks were right. We… we can’t escape our fates, I guess. [audience laughing] I was so worried about teeth, I was the most worried about them. When they didn’t seem to be a problem, I went the other way. I bought into my own mythology. “It’s like the cave people. It works. It’s internal poetry.” And with that idea, that mythology, they’ve been getting toothier. I know it. For sure. Every passing year, I know this jaw has just been slacking in closed. A couple of confident millimeters at a… All the while I’m fancying myself a tragic figure of blow job excellence. This was my worst nightmare. I was the fools. I was the two fools. But I wasn’t just someone who liked themself, a confident… No. I was the toothy blow job fool sisters. Just on our knees blowing someone. “Oh, best in the biz, no one quite like us.” “How will we ever leave town? Into the sunset must we go.” “Another satisfied customer. Another satisfied community.” [audience laughing] Oh God, just little smug little… [groans] No. I mean, you wanna deny it, but if he felt teeth, he felt teeth. What did you do, ask for more feedback to try to save face? “While we’re here perhaps you have some more constructive criticisms.” “I simply love to learn.” [audience chuckling] Tony Robbins says if you can learn to receive feedback with courage, you can be a giant. And I wanna be a giant, but who busts someone’s narrative like that. All we have is our stories. With a little term, “toothy blow job” that he likely learned at 14, hasn’t revised even a single time with his own language, just throws it at me and destroys me. And I feel wronged. I feel… I feel so wronged. And why, and it’s ’cause… [exhaling] I know that I cast the most generous gaze upon him, you know? I poeticize all of his flaws in real time. I love to poeticize a flaw, you know? And yes, I coddle the male ego. But it’s real, you know, a thousand things throughout the day just to bolster the male spirit. You know, 1,000 unspoken things, a constant vigilance, sort of. Keeping up a steady stream of laughter going under a man’s speech just in case anything he says is intended as humorous. I have to lay a base… [laughing] …so there’s something to modulate. “Oh, it’s supposed to be funny?” [laughs] [audience laughing] Right? If it’s a dry riverbed, the pops aren’t believable. I’m brilliant in a restaurant. You know, if a man I’m with… if he makes an error in his order, like he orders tahini, he meant tabouli, and now he’s confused why “salad dressing” has arrived at the table. “Where’s my tahini?” he says. What do I do? I go along on the mystery with him. “Oh I have no clue what happened. I was totally spaced out like I always am.” “You know me, the ditz. But let me grab a lantern, I love a mystery.” [audience laughing] “The only thing I know for sure is the answer to this riddle, it couldn’t be, it would never be, that you didn’t know a word.” [audience laughing] The D chord. I mean the D chord. I’ve learned 1,000 D chords on 1,000 guitars from 1,000 musician boyfriends. I know how to form the D chord by now, but show me again, bright angel, you know. [audience laughing] “That’s not it. That’s not it. Help me move my fingers.” “Help me make music.” It’s a… it’s a vigilance. It’s a child-proofing, just sort of laying down bumpers. Like, quick, quick, set them up. He’s almost here. He’s almost here. Is everything ready? Make sure. He’s almost here. Just making sure. Just making sure, you know, that it’s safe for the man to kind of just… toddle on through his day like a drunken king, having no clue how many times he came this close to emotionally just perishing, if not for my intervention alone. Just getting things out of the way and just watching you carefully. [audience laughing] Every guy, you know. Every',\n",
       "  \" guy I’ve, like, dated, met, worked for, worked for me, all of them. [sighs] Poeticizing their flaw, and I love to do it. And I do it without breaking a sweat. To not do the same for me on just this one thing? You know, to not return the favor, to not be able to find the beauty in the toothy blow job, when it’s barely obscured. I don’t even think this is a hard one, to not be able to romanticize something as easily romanticizable as a toothy blow job. I mean, have you no poetic eye, sir? Just no clue what makes anything in this life good at all? [exhales] And I wanted to defend myself, you know, you know, but then I remembered that idea that with every additional word you speak, you lose power, you know. The greatest defense is to say nothing at all. [exhales] That’s never really been my power. [audience laughing] My power has always been more like already been talking for quite some time. [audience laughing] Might as well keep talking to try to get it right. The courage, the audacity to offer diminishing returns. [audience laughing] So I say to him, I say to him, “You’re right.” “You’re right.” [sighing] I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. And that’s on purpose. [audience chuckling] Yeah. ‘Cause teeth, teeth make a blow job a blow job. Yeah. [audience laughing] Because teeth… Because teeth… Teeth make a blow job a blow job because teeth are how you know you’re in a mouth. [audience laughing and applauding] Teeth are the reminder that you’re in a mouth at all. What even is my mouth if it does not have teeth? [audience laughing] Just… just another perfect orifice? Just a roomier version of orifices we already have. Just another anus, another vagina, another greased-up tit canal. [audience laughing] Just yet another way to smoothly squeeze a dick so it may feel pure uncomplicated pleasure yet again. No, no, no, that is not meaningful or hot in the way a blow job can be. The blow job, it is about something more, and it is the teeth. It is the teeth that make it so. [audience chuckling] The teeth in the blow job, they’re the seeds in the watermelon. [audience chuckling] They keep the pleasure from being too complete. The teeth in the blow job, they’re the sand that irritates the oyster that produces the pearl. They’re the sea salt in the caramel. Remember in 2012, when they felt they had to go wide with that? [audience laughing] Some of the caramel people realized we’d all grown too accustomed to the taste. They said, “We need to put a reminder, something in every damn bite.” “Something that says, ‘No, sweetness is not guaranteed in this life.'” No, the blow job, it is inherently a flawed prospect. It’s a flailing human kind of spectacle. It’s almost a bad idea. [audience laughing] It almost doesn’t work, but then the ways you make it work nonetheless are that which make it work and that’s what’s moving about it. It’s like the little rubber guy in the cereal box, the little gummy guy you throw against the wall and he clings, but then he fails, but tries and fails, and tries and fails, and through his trying and failing and trying, he appears to crawl. And that’s why we love him. That’s what makes him a prize. That’s why we dig through the grains for him before we’ve earned him through the steady, daily eating of the cereal. The blow job moves me much like that. [audience chuckling] But at bare minimum, at bare, obvious minimum, the teeth in the blow job are the details that bring the textures to this life. The kind the English teacher promised us would illuminate the universal through the particular. They’re the plums in the icebox, the popping of my “P” sounds in the microphone. The “measuring out of life in coffee spoons, fog curling in the windowpane,” Garbo’s salary, cellophane, Zuzu’s petals. [exclaiming] Oh. Oh. The teeth in the blow job, they are Zuzu’s petals. They mean you’re… you’re alive and you’re in your life, and this time, you get it. This time you see it’s a wonderful life. [audience laughing] This time you see that you’re the richest man in town. [audience laughing] The teeth in the blow job, they raise the stakes. I mean, they… they send a Susan to her potential death. [audience laughing] But for faith and desire alone. And the teeth, they bring a bone to a boneless arena, to the boneless boner. The tongue shall rot. The penis shall rot. But the teeth… [cackling] …they shall remain. The teeth bring the centuries to the thing. [audience chuckling] A smooth, toothless blow job, that is a hobgoblin of little minds. No. Teeth ensure your blow job suffers no foolish consistency. No, a smooth, toothless blow job, it would allow for too flush a fit. It would be a round peg in a round hole kind of act, so you and another can feel as if you’re becoming one. No. No. What’s the fun in being one? No, let us be two. Let us feel the rough boundaries between us so we have something to push up against. [audience cheering and laughing] Don’t you see? The rows of our teeth, these are Romeo’s stony walls. [audience chuckling] These give love’s light wings something to have to o’er perch at all. And that’s why we must, we must, we must wipe the lip balm off. [audience laughing] And unwrap our lips from around our teeth and let our teeth drag. [audience laughing] We let them drag. [moaning] And if they don’t drag naturally, we still do it to make the point. [moaning] ‘Cause consider the ghost or the orb. If it were given a mouth again for a couple minutes, it wouldn’t quickly file down its teeth to try to make a more perfect seal with your dick. No. No. No goddess would ever take on the human form unless there was to be some strange beauty in the form’s very limitations. So no, I did not randomly blow you. Bah, bah! No, that was a visitation. Tremble in awe, bitch. [audience applauding and cheering] And of course… Of course, of course, I’m not degraded when I kneel down. No, no, not beneath you, no, but through you and past you and before our lives in humble awe at this strange human tragedy. [audience laughing] Your appendage, a small spigot, I drink the universe through. [audience laughing] Your body, a few clumsy phrases into which the splendor of the soul is poorly translated and yet I take the translation ’cause to understand completely and directly, I’d dissolve instantly and I guess I want my time in a body as I want my time as a ghost. [moaning intensely] And the lesson is not, by the way… I want to make it very cle… Actually, there is no lesson. My only goal is to entertain and delight. I am, after all, a nightclub act. [audience laughing] But the lesson is not if there was to be one… it’s certainly not, “save your blow jobs, save your blow jobs for those capable of appreciating their spiritual glory.” No, that’d make my tale a cautionary one, and I’ll have none of that, thank you. No, no. [exhaling] [audience cheering] No, no, regard my dignity. No. Might we give our blow jobs freely. Might we regret not a single one. Might we be an embarrassment of riches. [pants] Might our misunderstood blow jobs retain the dignity of their original intention. Might we be an embarrassment of riches like the ocean. Permit me but one last metaphor? [audience laughing] Might we be like the ocean. Does the ocean only lap up at the feet of men of letters who it already knows are capable of appreciating… “Hi. It’s me.” …and articulating its glory? No, the ocean rushes generously to the legs of fools, dunces, cowards, and assholes alike. And it is undiminished. It remains the ocean. I’m sorry. Do I overreach? [audience laughing] Indeed, I do, otherwise why reach at all, you know? And he didn’t know. [audience laughing] He thought there were holes in my argument. Perhaps some of you do as well. I hope you do ’cause don’t you know, I know there are. I put those there on purpose. ‘Cause the holes in my argument, these are the teeth in the blow job of my argument. [audience applauding] Would you believe it? Somehow, I win again. And this is how I shall self-appoint, make the rules, claim the throne, but the ecstasy of my reign, ah… it shall be in its very tenuousness… Fuck it. I’m the blow job queen.

His ability to connect personal experiences with wider social themes demonstrates not only his comedic talent but also a keen observational acuity, inviting audiences into a world where laughter serves as both an escape and a mirror to society. * * * Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the amazing Kevin Bridges! Thank you. Thank you! Thank you. Wow. Good evening! Good evening. Good evening, Cork! Thank you. Thank you, people of Cork. Thank you. Yes! This is… This is an honor. Thank you, good people, first of all, for coming out to this very special recording here in the stunning Cork Opera House. What a venue. Nice and intimate, we can see right into each other’s eyes here. It is… I was unsure whether I was going to record this tour, and then there was a bit of debate, and then I was in the cinema, watching Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy. And I thought, “Where do they make such handsome bastards?” Where on this earth? Get these people… Get these people on camera! And then, look at this front row here, so… The guy’s even wore… Is that a hoodie? Good man. That’s it, front row, in the opera house, on the telly. “Where’s my PE kit?” Good man. That’s decent people. Real people! Shorts as well. Just a last… a final run out for the spring/ summer collection, this guy. It’s exciting. Well done. Well done for coming out for a laugh. It’s important, innit, in this…? A hundred percent, mate. Wow, what the fuck happened there? Somebody… “A hundred percent, mate,” somebody replied. You don’t need to reply to everything I’m saying. It’s no’ fucking Gogglebox, mate. I’m right here. I’m going to hear you. You know what I mean? It’s not actually the telly. We’re just… making the telly. You’re here at the… Anyway what’s your name, mate? Mick. Mick. Where are you from, Mick? Dublin. Dublin. You’re fucking answering before I’ve even finished the question. Coming down here trying to get his wee fucking voice on my special! Anyway… Exactly. Fucking langer. Yeah! Mick never thought I had that in the fucking chamber, eh? As I was saying, Mick, it’s good to see people coming for a laugh. It is. It’s a tense world, innit? It’s edgy. It’s volatile. We’ve lived through a lot of shit. We don’t know what’s coming next. It is important to take a bit of time to have a chuckle. We’ve got a war going on that has dominated the news this year, which is… it’s quite hard to find humor in that, but there’s always an angle, no matter how bleak. For example, I thought it was quite amusing when the rest of the NATO countries were trying to convince Germany to send some tanks in to assist in the fight against Russia and Germany were unsure as to how that would look because it would be the first time that German tanks would be mobilized in Europe since the Second World War. I thought that was quite funny. To me, that was like watching an ex-alcoholic, and his pals are trying to convince him he can have one. Saying, “Come on, Germany, man, nothing mental. Just… Just a few tanks. I don’t mean a fucking mad one.” And Germany’s going, “I don’t know. I’ve still got the fear! I still look back and cringe at who I used to be, boys. I don’t know if that’s me anymore.” I was watching, waiting for it. Soon as one German tank’s fired, Germany’s fucking, “Right, where were we?” It is, it’s exciting. This is my first special. That’s what you need to call it these days. A DVD is really… But a special, that’s what the Americans call it. It’s not quite as convincing for a Cork audience, a special. “Oh, what makes it so fucking special?” It is… That’s the jargon these days. However… However, the war is… I know. Ireland, you’ve been helping Ukraine. I’ve seen that. See, every other country is sending them weapons. Just rooting for them, “Come on, wee man. Come on. Here, use that. Use that, wee man. I’m no’ fucking hitting him. Fuck that!” But, Ireland, you’re different. You’re sending nonlethal aid, so well done. Just sending them boxes of Tayto. “Try the new Buffalo Hunky Dorys if you get a chance, lads.” It is. This is my first show, first one in a while, now that the world is back to normal. It’s good to see Russell Brand back on the telly. By the time… By the time this is released, that could be a legal issue. But it did take me back. Sex addiction. Remember that shit? We used to celebrate creeps at the turn of the century. I don’t just mean just celebrities. They used to be fucking everywhere. People coming on daytime telly, opening up about their sex addiction. These guys, smarmy, “I must have bedded… I must have bedded over a thousand women, yeah.” And you’d have Eamonn Holmes sitting with a semi. “And do you ever have more than one woman in the bed at the same time? Ruth, would you let the man answer the question?” “Sorry, mate, you were saying there?” A lot has changed in my life. I don’t know how much you followed me over the years here in Cork, but a lot has changed for me. I’ve done stand-up for almost 20 years, which is scary. It is. I’m the old… I’m the old pro. I’ve become a husband. Now, this is… I used to go on these stages talking about empties and house parties, and now I’m a husband. I got married. That’s a big step in anybody’s life, innit? Romantic. I proposed. Big Kev proposed on a safari. There we go. Big Kev proposed in Africa. Got myself a good deal on a diamond. Done a bit of haggling with the local rebel militia. I became a husband and then I became a father as well for the first time. Thank you. I never thought I would see the day I’d be a husband and a father and I’m 36. And… you start going, “Am I fucking… Am I old? Am I?” I’m still relatively young, innit? But I’m at an age where I now appreciate reminders of my relative youth. Like, cos I’ve dabbled, right? I’ve dabbled in being old and it did not suit me and it was refreshing. I said something old a few months ago. I was putting something in my kitchen bin, and I was looking out my window and there were children in the street just playing a game, an old-school game. They never had their tablets or devices, and I thought it was quite nice. And as I was putting my trash in the can, I said to my wife, “Isn’t it great to see children',\n",
       "  \" out playing?” And as soon as that sentence left my mouth, the young me was still in there, saying, “Wow, Kev, what a nonce comment.” “Far too young, Kev, far too young. Decades away from being able to stand at the window making such a statement. Don’t fucking wave at ’em, Kev. One of them’s seen you. You’ll get the front door kicked in, Kev. Thirty-six, man! You ever seen a 36-year-old lollipop man, Kevin? No. Cos it would be arrestable to apply for such a vacancy.” I’m still new to the game, the fatherhood game. You need to decide what kind of dad you’re gonna be. If you’re gonna take the Dwight York hands-off approach or… If you’re… gonna get in there… If you’re gonna get in there. See, my… See, my son was born… My son was born in 2021. What a time to enter the world. What a decade it has been so far, and I hope there’ll be a time we can look back and laugh at the fucking surreal madness that we have lived through. I was born in the ’80s and we love the ’80s, right? We still celebrate the ’80s and I sometimes ponder if there’ll be a day when my son has grown up and I’ll walk into his bedroom and I’ll see him standing there in the mirror with 24 toilet rolls under his armpit, a face mask under his chin, deep throating a cotton bud, going… And I’ll be saying, “Where are you going?” And he’ll be saying, “It’s a ’20s night, Dad, at the student union.” And this madness will come back. I’ll be saying, “Who’s going?” “Oh, just me and no more than five other people from three different households.” Remember all that shit we lived through, where only three households could socialize? Having to be ruthless, planning any social event, having to break it to your mate who lived on his own that he cannae come to your barbecue because he’s a waste of a house. “I’ll just tell him, ‘Sorry, Gary, you’re no’ coming, mate. I can get four in there. Mate, it’s my birthday. I’m no’ playing a four-four-one on my birthday.'” We did live through it. We’ve got inquiries going on everywhere. Every country’s having an inquiry into how Covid was handled, inquiries worldwide. I don’t know if you followed, over the UK, we had two years under Covid restrictions, whilst the House of Commons was like fucking Magaluf. I think that’s what happened. Boris Johnson and them, they were partying the whole way through it. The proper lockdowns as well, April and May 2020, right in the midst of the family quiz, sitting, your head shaved, the whole family, like marines. Saturday night, iPhones propped up against Yankee candles. “How many hearts does an octopus have?” The whole time, Boris Johnson was on the decks, fucking, “Order, order!” Whilst we were in supermarkets forgetting tomato purée, petrified to perform a three-point turn up a one-way aisle. People glaring at you, “My dad’s got asthma, you maniac! That way!” I think Covid… I think it’s gone. I’m pretty sure it’s over. I don’t know if it is. I think there’s still lockdowns in China, but it’s fucked off home. After… After a successful world tour, it’s back. It’s gone. And I don’t know. It killed six million people. Wow! I know. It’s big numbers, but I don’t know if that’s hall of fame when you look at the rest of the big pandemics throughout human history. You know what I mean? The real big hitters. The Spanish flu, that killed 50 million. The black death killed 200 million and Covid, six. Covid was even claiming assists towards the end. Covid… Anything! “My 95-year-old grandfather died from Covid!” “Come on. That’s a tap-in, man.” A bit of black ice was getting him. We can’t have Covid running away like Alan Shearer celebrating that. But it got the whole world closed. That was impressive. We’ll never see that again. Even McDonald’s closed. Wow! Even churches, even places of worship forced to close. That was massive. What a time in human history. We witnessed a time where organized religion listened to science. Wow! That’s a big one. For years, they’ve dismissed everything the scientists had to say. “The Big Bang? Nah. Evolution? Nah. A dry continuous cough and changes to your sense of taste and smell? Fucking shut the cathedral! These geeks have got a point this time! Somebody sanitize the synagogue!” Two Christmases got canceled. I don’t think religion can ever recover. Jesus’s birthday, canceled, twice. A big birthday as well, a 2021st, innit? Just fucking gone. Gone. That’s what my son was born into. Anyway, it is. Fatherhood, it’s new. Thanks to you people. I don’t know, again. A bit of my backstory for those of you unfamiliar with my previous work. But I grew up… I grew up in an area that you could describe as humble, right? And then for the past… for the past maybe decade, I’ve lived in a nicer part of the city of Glasgow. I’ve lived amongst the upper middle classes, the upper echelons, and I’ve never quite fitted in there, right? But… But now my son has been born, it has granted me my citizenship, right? I’m having to accept that my son’s gonna have a totally different upbringing from me. Even their names… Kids have got names like Phineas. Your parenting is being judged. I’m having lunch in a café. I hear, “Phineas, Phineas, if you don’t finish your tofu, there’ll be no almonds.” I’m sitting… Phineas is beating his dad at chess and I’m on the table beside ’em, hungover, close to tears, wiping bolognese off a smashed iPad. See, my wife took my son into a class. I don’t know if any parents in here have ever heard of this, a class called baby yoga. I said to my wife, “This is insanity. This is a middle-class radicalization of our son.” Baby yoga, right? She signed up for a block. I never knew babies needed yoga for a start. I never knew babies were suffering from tight hamstrings. Babies were terrified to go on the see-saw. “Can’t do that.” “I cannae. I cannae afford any more sickies, mate. I’m at nursery four days a week now. I cannae fall further behind. There’s boys in that class can hang their jacket on their own peg now. I cannae afford to risk it.” And I was laughing at baby yoga, and my wife said, “No, it’s just a nice way for me to meet other new mothers.” Which means I’m going to have to meet other new fathers. I’m getting dragged on these double dates. My wife’s going, “Fiona from baby yoga has invited us over for dinner. Her husband Gavin sounds like a nice guy. I think you’ll really get on with Gavin.” I probably will, but I’m 36 now. I’m not really taking on mates anymore. The transfer window closes at 30 for any realistic chance of a meaningful friendship. My wife says, “It’ll be nice. We’ll go for dinner.” I’m in the living room. I’m having to socialize with the people who I have mocked over the years for your entertainment. I’m sitting… “So, Kevin, do you watch Formula One, Kev? You an F1 fan, Kev? Big, er, big Grand Prix on Sunday, Kev.” “Fuck me, man. You have any absinthe, Gav?” See… See, people are people, I believe, right? I don’t judge anybody for their class. I don’t mean to be a reverse snob. This is a new expression I learned when you m\",\n",
       "  'ock the upper middle classes. They’re just different people from what I’m used to. I was walking my dog and this is when I like to eavesdrop. I was walking my dog through my neighborhood and I heard a kid, a schoolkid, boasting, boasting about being the best swimmer in his school. He was boasting to his mates about being the best swimmer, as though that carried some form of playground clout, to be regarded as the best swimmer at school. He’s going, “Everyone knows it’s me for a fact. Ask anybody in the school who the best swimmer is. I guarantee they’ll say me. I’m the best swimmer. It’s just a fact. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows it’s me. It’s just a fact.” And I was walking away, contemplating, did I know the best swimmer at my school? And I came to the conclusion, no, because it was irrelevant, right? It was never a means with which to forge yourself a reputation. That was done through being good at football, being good at fighting, or being fucking mental, right? Those were the three accepted forms of currency: football, fighting, or bouncing a Bunsen burner off a supply teacher’s Ford Fiesta. That’s how you earned respect in a working-class school. Never did I witness anybody strip to their Speedos, shouting, “Fucking come on! I’ll take you a length, then. Come on! Name your stroke, mate! Name your stroke! I’ll get my dad down here to butterfly every fucking one of youse!” And it made me look back on my own upbringing. That’s what parenthood does. It makes you realize more than ever how much your childhood shapes the person you become. And I looked back on my own school life. I was shite at football. I was not particularly mental. I never knew how to fight. I certainly never knew how to fight. I was in a couple of fights at school. I lost them all heavily. But I was at a school… I was at school at a time where a bit… a bit of bullying, in moderation, could be beneficial for your character development. Right? Once you’ve been beat up a couple of times, there’s life lessons there. “There you go, Kev. You don’t know how to fight. Stay out of fights.” And I have carried that aversion to confrontation well into my adult life. And I’ve realized that can leave you vulnerable. Especially when you become a parent, you need to learn to stand up for yourself within reason. Like, especially amongst the upper middle classes cos they can be very confrontational people, because they don’t necessarily associate confrontation with violence. Now, I’ll give you an example, right? I… I live in an apartment, right? And I’ve got one upstairs neighbor, and I used to have a bike and I kept the bike at the door of my apartment rather than bringing it inside, just out of convenience. And I never knew this was irritating the upstairs dude, until one evening, he came to my door to ask me to bring my bike inside my apartment because in his words, “It was ruining the esthetic of the communal hallway.” Now, that is a guy who has never been punched in the fucking face. That’s a guy… That is a guy who has never been dragged from a moving dodgem and leathered at the Christmas and New Year carnival. He does not come from a world where he sees how that could easily turn ugly, to go to somebody’s door to ask them to move their bike from their door. If I was to go to somebody’s door with such a request, I would be fully prepared for physical combat. I would… I would assemble a bit of backup beforehand, draft in a few cousins. “Aye, it’s his door, mate. Aye, his bike. Cos it’s fucking ruining the esthetic in the communal hallway.” I could have stood up for myself in that situation. I could’ve said, “Mate, it’s my bike. It’s my door.” I could’ve fought prick with prick, but because of my childhood, I apologized to the guy. I said sorry and I brought the bike inside and then I closed the door. And that man shuffled off back up the stairs, having won. And I closed the door, and it’s just me and my bike and the door’s shut. That’s when it becomes an issue, cos the voices in there… the voices in there become like a pop-up virus, “Fucking pathetic, Kev, absolutely embarrassing. That was tough to watch, Kev. Fucking…” “Oh, I’m so sorry. Let me just bring the bike inside. Sorry for your inconvenience. Kev, get a new bike if that’s the way you’re gonna be. Get a wee basket on the front, Kev. That’s the kind of bike you should get. Get some ribbons on the handlebars, Kev. Get a wee bell. Ding-ding! Here comes Big Kev.” “Oh, I’m so sorry! Kev, get a wee bichon frisé and stick it in the basket when you go for a cycle.” And that is the psychology of men, cos those minor defeats, they stay on a file somewhere in there. You believe you have deleted those cookies, but they stay in there. That is why men lose the fucking plot with wireless printers and… and broadband routers. Because the minute they feel uptight and frustrated, every minor defeat they have ever accepted replays like a montage, a compilation in there. You’ll be trying to pair a Bluetooth speaker in front of your whole family on Christmas Day. “Device not recognized.” You’re clicking and clicking. Everybody sees you’re starting to get freaked out and they start trying to help, “Kevin, have you tried moving it further away? Sometimes the Bluetooth can actually be too close. I read that somewhere. Kevin, is it updated? Does it need an update perhaps? Kevin, have you tried turning it off and back on again?” “You’ve fucking literally just seen me trying that!” “Oh, my God, Kevin. We don’t need music that badly.” “It’s not about the music! It’s about that prick in 2019 that made me move my bike from my fucking door! I’m a coward! I’m a coward.” I’m trying to look after myself. I’ve lost a bit of weight as well. Er… I’ve tried… Thank you. I lost weight before. What was that? Up the Celtic! What did you shout? The Celtic! Have I got a fucking lazy eye? It was clearly somebody there and it’s just moved. You shouted, “Up the Celtic.” Right. That’s good, but was that… Why did you just shout that randomly… in connection to weight loss? What’s your name, sir? Cillian. Cillian. Cillian? Is that the name here in Cork? Cillian. Where are you from, Cillian? I’m from the north. You’re from the north, as in the north of Ireland or the north of Cork? I just need to know how… how much we’ve zoomed in on the Google map here. The north of this city or this country? The country. The country. All right, fucking relax, mate. Wow, that’s an accent, innit? “The fucking country.” “There’s a fucking bomb in the biscuit tin. Everybody, get out. Everybody, get fucking out.” I was up there. I love it, going up there, up the fucking north. I wanted to open a Chinese takeaway on the Shankill Road, Cillian. I was… I was gonna call it The Orange Wok, right? I thought it’d be funny. I thought it’d be a good business venture. The family… The family meal deal, 1690. That’s the price… Everybody phoning up, “Can I have the fuck Sinn Fein chow mein?” “Oh, not a problem.” There we go. That was for you, Ci',\n",
       "  'llian. Can I carry on here? Right, thank you. Good man. Started talking about my weight-loss journey. It was actually… I used to be a big dude, right? Right, I lost weight probably about eight years ago, er, and then the body positive movement showed up. Just as I had lost weight, it became acceptable and celebrated to be fat, right? I doubt you can even say that word anymore, cos it’s fat… Even fucking Ann Summers, in the window, they’ve got lingerie models just standing in fucking gravy-stained suspenders. See… But we never had that support back when I was a big dude and it’s a shame for guys like myself that just lost weight at the wrong time, right? Cos my weight-loss journey probably started on the telly. I played in a charity football game, Soccer Aid, the ITV show, and it was the rest of the world against England, right? Ex-footballers and celebrities, and I was quite excited. This is back when I was a big fella. I was a portly lad. But I was invited to play for the rest of the world. José Mourinho, he’s the manager, and I was told I was gonna get five minutes on the pitch, Old Trafford, in front of 70,000, live on the telly, millions watching at home. I’m quite excited. The football fans among you will know that five minutes on the pitch probably implies you’re gonna get brought at minute 85. So I’m in the dugout, on the subs bench, just chilling. The game’s going on, then it gets to minute 60 on the clock, minute 60. José Mourinho turns and tells me to go and start warming up. I’m thinking, “Fuck me. I’m getting half an hour on this pitch.” “That’s it, Kev. The gaffer must have seen something in training.” Going down the stairs, I break into this jog alongside the advertising boards, “Whoa, Kev, keep a bit in the tank, man, 30 minutes. You’ll take a clutcher here.” I’m just standing, trying to remember some stretches from PE at school, just settling for that bastard. Then I get shouted back up. Then I get brought on the pitch and then five minutes later, I get brought straight back off the pitch, subbed on, subbed off, humiliated on national telly and then I stupidly checked the Twitter comments and the vile trolls had fat-shamed me. They had made a video with the Benny Hill theme tune in fast-forward mode of me jogging on, my tits bouncing through my jersey, trying to control a pass and then jogging straight back off again. I was fat-shamed and it motivated me to get in shape. Then as soon as I lose a bit of weight, you can no longer fat-shame people, so that is a miscarriage of justice for somebody who’d done 28 years of their life as a fat bastard. The body positive movement can fuck off. I done… I done 28 years for a crime and upon my release, I find out it’s no longer a crime. That’s what I went through. I’m trying… I’m fucking… I’m trying to stay… I’m trying to stay relatively fit. Once you become a parent, you need to try and work on getting a few years towards the end. That’s all I can hope for. Just trying to keep a couple of stone in a savings account for later in life. I tried at the gym. What was that? Somebody’s translating. Thank you. We’ve got somebody here to interpret for whatever the fuck you just said there. What did he say? “Fair play to your eyesight.” Fair play to my eyesight. I don’t… Do you understand that? No? OK. Fair play to my eyesight? Even he’s shrugging his shoulders. Look. He literally just done that as if he’s managed to confuse himself there. Is there a bag of spice getting passed about that balcony? The fuck? “Fair play to your eyesight! What do you mean?” Wow, this is why we record the special here, because it’s a bit mental. Good people. I was gonna ask you your name, mate. But that is maybe a bit too advanced. It’s good. Anyway, what was I talking…? The gym! The gym! That’s it. How old are you, mate? The guy in the white jumper there. Nineteen. Nineteen, the youth. What’s your name? Odhran. Owen? Odhran. Oran, Oran. O-R-A-N? O-D-H-R-A-N. Oh, for fuck’s sake, man. This is like Deal or No Deal. I could’ve went to anybody there. And I somehow hit the fucking quarter of a million box. Er, say how spell it again. O-D-H-R-A-N. O-D-H-R… D-H is silent. D-H, it’s silent? All right. So, Oran. Is that enough if I just call you Oran? Good man. Wow. Just you shut up. This’ll blow your mind. Yeah, this is a fucking quantum physics lecture now. “But why would a letter be silent?” “I don’t know, mate. It’s just the way it is. Calm down.” Oran, Oran. What I’m saying is the young… the generation, the youth, you take the gym serious, right? This new breed of young people, they make the gym a hostile environment for somebody like myself who’s just in for a bit of physical and mental maintenance. The youth, they no longer drink as much, right? They no longer smoke hash. They no longer sniff glue. The youth, the Instagram generation, they’re straight in with the protein shakes, on the steroids, in the Octagon with their wee skin-tight hot pants, 69-ing their best mate. These wee… trained assassins. They’re everywhere. These gym fiends carrying these big water… ridiculous-sized water containers. Every city center I’ve been in recently, these young guys are swaggering through. I know you’re supposed to drink three liters of water a day, but you don’t need to carry it in the one container. Call center-sized water dispensers. You want to say, “Excuse me, mate. How long did you intend to spend away from a running tap this afternoon?” “Are you traveling 40 miles to the nearest village to fill that up every morning?” That’s where I went, and I was at a class in the gym. See, I don’t know exercises, right? The gym to my generation used to be you go on the treadmill for five minutes. For as long as “Insomnia” by Faithless lasted You would maybe speed it up towards the end, then you would do a couple of them and then sauna, steam-room, vending machine, home. That was the gym. But now the kids have got programs. Got a program. Strength goals. “Strength goals, man. My program.” I went to the class. The guy’s telling everybody the circuits to follow. He’s shouting out exercises I’d never fucking heard of in my life. He’s going, “We’re gonna start off with one minute, one minute of Bulgarian bag spins.” “One minute of Russian split-squats. One minute of Romanian dead-lifts.” I’m thinking, “Do you have any exercise which originated in a happy country?” Fuck this. None of this was designed to help anybody’s mental health, mate. These are all the products of brutal Soviet regimes! And we’re paying ten quid to a capitalist to attend a gulag on a Saturday morning. And I’d never done a squat before. For those of you unfamiliar, the squat, it’s all the Instagram, wellness, fitness influencers. It looks good, the squat, but there’s a dark side to the squat they don’t tell you about and I learned this in a painful manner, in a painful and degrading and humiliating manner. I was holding a bit of weight there, a kettlebell, and then you need to lower yourself into a seated position,',\n",
       "  ' and it looks good. It’s probably good for your physical health and mental health. But I don’t yet believe that the human sphincter… …has evolved to withstand such pressure. I was doing these every week and adding a bit of weight on until, one day, I just felt an intense pain and a very specific unique pain that I had never felt before in the most intimate of orifices in the male body. And I don’t mind being candid here, Cork. I felt a proper… Like, flights to Switzerland, Dignitas, end it all. What the fuck have you just done here, Kevin? I had to leave the class and then leave the gym. I had to drive home on one arse cheek as the pain gradually intensified and basically, I gave myself piles, I later learned out. I don’t mean… You need to discuss these things, hemorrhoids. I’d never suffered from piles or hemorrhoids until I tried to get myself in shape. I don’t mind opening up. It is important that we discuss rectal health. I will gladly be the poster boy for rectal health awareness. You get one arsehole in this life. Look after it. Don’t suffer in silence. Ex… Exactly. I was terrified. I had to rush up the stairs into my bathroom. I had to pull down my shorts and inspect my own arsehole in the mirror. I’d never seen piles. I’d only heard about them. I thought it was only women who’d just given birth who got them, or old people. It’s quite a scary… When you first see foreign bodies growing from your arse, it’s alarming. “What the fuck have you done here, Kev?” I had to get my iPhone and turn the torch on just to get a… Quickly locked the bathroom door in case my wife walks in and just sees this. “Oh, I’ve set up an Only Fans page!” I’m looking in the mirror… going, “What the fuck is this?!” It’s scary. Piles! That’s the bit. I phoned. I panicked. I never knew that hemorrhoids, they’re relatively harmlessly. I just panicked at the time. “What the fuck is this?” I phoned the doctor. The doctor refused to see me. That is a bit of Covid debris I hope we can eventually lose. The over-the-phone doctor’s consultation. Cos there’s some situations you just need a doctor to see it for himself. You… You need the fucking fair play to your eyesight off the doctor. You need… Right, especially… I just believe the over-the- phone doctor’s consultation, there is way too much dependent on your use of descriptive language. I don’t think you should need to be Oscar Wilde just to get yourself a prescription. I’m in the mirror. How the fuck am I gonna explain what I can see to a doctor, over the phone? I’m trying to workshop some imagery. Er… “It’s kind of… you ever play snooker, Doctor? You ever… You ever been playing snooker and too many balls get potted into one pocket?” To cut to the story, I was basically told I had piles and it was nothing to worry about and the doctor told me to go and buy a cream and it was fine. I don’t know if anybody knows the name of the cream. The cream is called Anusol. Right, that is… that is how subtle these pharmaceutical geeks decided to make the name for that cream, Anusol. They could’ve called that anything. They could’ve gone as niche and as esoteric as their big PhD brains would allow, but, no. They went for a cheap laugh at the expense of people’s poor rectal health. Anusol. I had to go to Boots to buy some. My wife accompanied me. And we got to Boots and on the Boots shelf, they never had the Anusol that I required. I thought, “I’m just gonna have to leave it then. I’ll just need to suffer in silence.” My wife said, “No, usually in Boots, if you walk over, they’ve got extra stock behind the counter.” I said, “Are you fucking insane?” “You want me to walk over and ask that guy if he’s got any Anusol cream for my external hemorrhoids?” I said, “I’m just gonna leave it.” And my wife called me immature. My wife called me a child, called me a baby, told me to grow up and I just stood letting her insults bounce off my gormless expression, patiently waiting in the hope that maybe she would suggest that she walk over on my behalf. He’s going, “First of all, Kevin, it’s called Anyu-sol. Not Anusol. Anyus…” I said, “Are we talking Spanish here? I don’t see a squiggle above the N. You cannae… You cannae just conceal the word anus inside another word and expect people to manipulate the pronunciation. Do you look at the planets? Oh, look at Uran-yus? No. Don’t try and defend big pharma.” And then my wife said, “Fine. I’ll go over.” And that’s true love. That’s when you know you have married the one. I watched my wife… “You’re my everything, my soulmate.” I’ve got Spandau Ballet playing as I’m watching my wife walk on over. I don’t know if I loved my wife more watching her walk up the aisle on our wedding day, or watching her walk up this Boots aisle on this, the darkest of days, for my rectal health. I turn to the shelf and start putting together my meal deal. The afternoon’s suddenly looking promising, a BLT, a packet of tangy cheese Doritos. I look over to see how my wife’s progressing, and she has got her elbow on the Boots counter, engaged in dialogue with the Boots worker and then her upper body gradually begins performing a 180, as she is pointing back over… Fucking grassed on and exposed as a coward! I went to put my juice and my sandwich and my crisps under my left arm so I can wave at the Boots worker, wave a wee acknowledgement as she is mentally processing an image of my shattered hoop. So, I made a full recovery, you’ll be glad to know, people of Cork. That’s it. Thank you. My arse is back in the game. That’s why you need to watch. Let that be a lesson, any of the gym people, with the squats and all this… all the high protein, all the high protein… “Strength goals, man. Strength goals.” It is. It’s a shame, innit? Every nutritionist is always dragging, like, bread, for example. As you get slightly older, I believe you just find the foods that suit you. Bread’s your best friend, man. Don’t listen to these protein extremists. Yeah, bread has been… Bread got cancelled. Bread has been treated like a sex offender since the Atkins diet. Every single diet involves cutting out bread. Everywhere you look, “Don’t eat bread. Bread is making you tired.” Really? You ever seen a duck yawning? That’s… That is a simple bit of research that anybody is free to conduct. I’ve never took my son to the park, walked up to the pond and seen fucking quack-quack… Quack, quack. “Oh, look at the ducks, son. They’re fucking exhausted, aren’t they? Wow. Too much starchy carbohydrates, that’s what that is, pal.” I think that would be an asset in this hectic, modern world if bread made you tired, if it was that easy to be tired on demand. I’m tired. I’m tired the whole day. I’m tired. I spend the whole fucking day exhausted, and it’s only when I get to bed at night and eventually turn off the telly, and I close my eyes, that’s when I come alive. Right? My… My mental health is quite, quite good until the evenings and I know… I know as soon as I turn off the telly, and it’s just me, alone, inside',\n",
       "  ' of me, I know I’ve got exactly one minute to get sleeping, or somebody is gonna storm the cockpit. And we are gonna lose all contact with air traffic control and go way off on these turbulent journeys. And that is when I would need a wee bedside baguette just to take the edge off. If… I try… I try so hard to take a sleep serious. I put my phone away in the corner. “You stay there, phone. Don’t come near me. Stay on the charger. I’ll see you tomorrow. I’m here for a sleep.” I’m lying awake, scared to turn off the telly. “I don’t think you’re tired enough, Kev. Just keep flicking, man. Keep flicking.” Australian traffic police, I’m watching… “How fast were you going there, mate? Yeah. What does the sign say, mate? What does the sign say?” “That’s it, Kev. It’s his voice, or whatever voice is in there. I don’t think you’re tired. Keep flicking.” I’m away up the back on the History Channel, The Rise and Fall of Adolf Hitler, a nice wee soothing bedtime story. They always stick that guy on at two in the morning. I’m lying watching him. His mental health was poor. Wow. He killed himself. It just shows. You don’t know what’s going on inside somebody’s head. I’m watching that guy. He was the picture of self-assurance. He’s standing in front of… Standing in front of hundreds of thousands, oozing self-confidence, going… I don’t know what the fuck he’s saying, but it never once sounded like, “Guys, I’m struggling.” That’s when I’m lying awake, going, “When did that start, man? How did you end up like that?” That’s why you need to open up way before it gets to that. I’m angry at Hitler’s mates back in the day. They must’ve seen signs when that bitterness descended. As soon as he got knocked back from art school, I bet there was nights, having a few beers, Hitler’s on his sparkling water, wee chip on his shoulder cos he got rejected. Fucking, “See these fucking Jews?” “Whoa!” “Fuck’s sake, Dolf.” Everybody has a nickname back in the day. Maybe that was Hitler’s. “It’s not the Jews’ fault your paintings are shite, Dolf.” “And fucking ditch that tache. You’re creeping out the birds.” And that would’ve been it. That would’ve been the end of him. I’m lying awake contemplating alternative histories. Hitler would just be… maybe even a stoner, with these fucked-up thoughts, innit? Just walking about Vienna. “Imagine the whole world had blond hair and blue eyes.” That’s where my brain goes at night. That’s why you need bread, man. Lying awake, just watching… watching Hitler, cos I know, that’s what happens to me. That’s what happens. As soon as I turn off the telly, as soon as it’s just me, alone, inside of me, the minute passes and that wee voice comes in, “I wonder what happens when you die, Kevin.” Here we fucking go. “This is a daytime conversation. Why do you ask this shit at night?” “Ah, you’re always too busy during the day, Kev. You’re always hiding, fucking hiding. I’ll be here, Kev. Every single night, I’ll be here waiting. You can hide all day long, on Instagram watching Ashley Banjo get a haircut, but I will be here, Kev. I wonder what happens when you die, Kev.” “I don’t fucking know.” “You better have a think, cos you’re gonna die.” “That’s fucking right. I’m gonna fucking die.” “Everybody’s gonna die, Kev.” “That’s fucking true. Everybody’s gonna die.” “I wonder how many people have ever died.” “What do you mean, like, ever?” “Aye.” “That’s a good question. I wonder how many… That is a good question. Do you think more people have died than there are alive right now?” “Surely, Kev.” “I wonder how many people there’s ever been then.” “Do you mean, like, ever?” “Aye, everybody who has ever died plus everybody alive right now.” “Kev, that is a fantastic question.” “How many people has there ever been? That’s a terrific question.” And that’s when you feel your phone in the corner, going… “Kev! I know that, mate! Kev! Kev! I know the answer, bro! Come on down! We’ll make a fucking night of it, me and you, bro!” “Come on out of bed, man. Come on out of bed!” And I’m up and I’m out of the bed and I’m crouching down. “How many people has there ever been?” “Good to see you, Kev, mate. I thought you’d fucked off for the night. I love these nights when it’s just me and you. ‘How many people has there ever been?’ Always a great question with you, Kev. ‘How do you say turkey in Turkish?’ That was a good one as well, Kev. Remember on holiday in Turkey? You were eating turkey. You should’ve said to one of the staff, ‘What do you call this?’ That would’ve been funny. ‘How many people have…’ Kev, have you seen a cat’s dick?” “No. That’s weird. Why have I never seen a cat’s willy?” “Let’s have a look, then, Kev. Google Images. There we go, two in the morning, looking at cat cock. That’s why I love you, Kev. Kev, what about Bitcoin? Come on. Once a week, me and you attempt to finally understand how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies work. This could be the night it eventually sinks ins. Let’s have a wee look, Kev. Come on. Just pay attention. ‘How does Bitcoin…?’ Well, Bitcoin operates from a decentralized network, using encrypted peer-to-peer blockchain technology. Kev, see you can get a white chocolate Kinder Bueno these days? I still see the Kinder Bueno as quite a new thing, but you get things like that. They’ve been out for ages, but you still see them as new, like euros. When did the euro originally come out? 1999! Holy fuck! You were only 13 back then, Kev. That is how fast time moves. You’re gonna die, Kev. You’re gonna fucking die. Look at the size of that cat’s willy. Is that even a cat?” That is why… That is… That is why if I just had a wee multiseed bagel, I could just… I could just control-alt-delete into a wee peaceful slumber. That’s all you need to do. We need to watch the phones. Everybody’s the same. Everybody’s hooked on the phones. That’s what’s causing the mental health epidemic. Somebody recommended jogging to me, right? Just to make you look calm and all that stuff, and I tried it. That’s the two positive lifestyle changes I made recently. I tried to take up jogging and I tried to cut back on social media. But what I learned is that jogging is in a co-dependent relationship with social media. I learned it. I managed a 5K, right? That was quite… For a former portly fella, I was quite chuffed that I managed to run for five kilometers. And then my brain felt valeted, right? Your brain floods with dopamine and endorphins and serotonin, right? You feel… You feel like Ric Flair. You’re just walking about going, “Whoo! Whoo!” But that bit of your brain that Mark Zuckerberg controls is also there, saying, “Kev, you think that feels happy? You think that’s dopamine? Wait until you screenshot your time and your distance covered and your calories burned and post it on the socials and every like that you get is gonna spike that dopamine even further.” And that’s when I thought, “This is a form of gambling.” That’s what social media is. If life presents you with a moment of genuine offline happiness and',\n",
       "  \" fulfillment, you need to learn just to cash out, right? Cos it can backfire, as I learned. I posted my time and I’m excited cos I know every like is gonna spike that dopamine even further. I got greedy. I doubled down on the dopamine, cos I’m chasing the likes. That is the social media currency, the like. But it’s a volatile market and the snide comment will always be strong against the like, as I learnt. I’m euphoric, posted my time and then the comments came in, “Were you fucking pulling a caravan, Kevin?” Honest, yeah. “Did you walk it, Kev? It looked like you moon-walked it at that pace, ha-ha.” Strangers are bonding in the replies. And that’s when I realized happiness is found offline, genuine happiness. Like, I enjoy a Sunday morning these days. I enjoy a Sunday as a family man. And shortly after… shortly after my son was born, I was… I was in bed on a Sunday. My son was having his nap beside me, under my arm. I’m in bed, my son, just there sleeping. My wife came over and she said, “Aw,” and she joined us. And it was a Sunday morning. The Simpsons is on the telly. And then my dog came in and jumped up beside me on that side, I’m sitting going, “This is life. This is it.” You feel your soul expanding, but Zuckerberg is there… …saying, “Kev, this is what we play for, man. This is… This is wholesome content, Kevo. Get the selfie. Get it. Post it. The baby, the dog, the wife, the Sunday, the family goals. Get it on there, Kev.” And I know how that would’ve went. I was tempted, but I thought, “No, this is how this’ll go. I will post a picture. I’m happy, I’m fulfilled, I’m greedy. I’m suddenly at the high-stakes table and the likes would come in and all the comments, ‘Oh my God, Kevin, too cute. Oh, my God, too cute! Oh, my God. Wholesome content. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Just this. Oh, my God, thisssss! This is everything, Kevin. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Family is everything, Kevin. Savor every moment. Oh, my God.'” But I’m fully aware that in there, there’s gonna be, “Your dog’s a cunt.” I’m fully aware. I know the dopamine chips can only pile so high, but at any point, the dealer can just go, woof, and I would abandon my family, abandon the moment. Suddenly, I’m on a stranger’s page. “My dog’s a cunt? Who the fuck is this?” Clicking on his pictures, “Is that his dog? His dog’s a cunt.” Then my wife would hear. “Did you just call somebody’s dog a cunt?” “Aye, cos he just called our dog a cunt. Whose side are you on?” We’re arguing. My son would wake up crying. My dog would sense tension, jump off the bed. The Simpsons would finish. That wee Hollyoaks opening guitar tune would start. That wee… So, that’s my point. When the fun stops, stop. Right? Just… Just accept happiness when it presents itself. That was the point of that bit. That’s what I think. I’m quite new to Instagram. I know it’s a bit old school. I just joined up recently. I never knew how it worked. My wife’s on Instagram and I was on my wife’s page and there’s a picture of my wife with this stunning guy. And I was like, “Who the fuck is that?” Then I looked closer and it was me. Right? I was like… I was a solid ten. I was smoking. And I said to my wife, “How did you manage to get that out of this?” She said, “Oh, I just used a filter.” I never knew that’s what Instagram is, just turning munters to rides in one click. One click! And we looked amazing. This is what we’re selling. Everybody does the same. If you’re somewhere shite, you can just take the pictures and make it look good and convince… Me and wife are standing on a romantic city break. We’re in front of some ancient building. I’m looking at the picture. The memories are coming back and I’m thinking, “Wait. We never spoke a fucking word that afternoon on that wee romantic mini-break.” That is the harsh reality of a real relationship. The romantic mini-break, it’s good for maybe a day and then day two, you realize you’ve signed up for a school trip as adults, having to put a wee itinerary together, going to look at more buildings, having to read placards, visit abandoned prisons, having to look at statues, just killing time between meals. Fucking hell, another gallery, another museum. Scared to look at the time. “Far too early to suggest an Irish bar, Kev, far too early. Wait. It’s only half eleven, Kev. Don’t you dare suggest a nine-euro Heineken at Dicey O’Reilly’s. Come on, Kev. You’ve got one more gallery, Kev.” And then what happens on a romantic mini-break, maybe day two or day three, a silence descends between you and your partner, a silence from nowhere. You’ll be aware you’re being a bit quiet yourself and you’re also aware your partner is being a bit quiet, but you know if you’re the first one to accuse the other one of being a bit quiet, you know you’re lighting a fuse there that could ignite and combust into a weekend-defining argument. So, what I have learned, one little bit of advice, what I have learned is when you feel that silence descend between you and your partner, start making comments. Start saying shit. Say any old shit. Just get shit said. Start building yourself a case. Start saying shit that you can later rely on as evidence… …for when you’re accused of being the one being quiet. And then when it does eventually come to the hearing, you storm in there with your body of evidence. “Me? Me? I’m being quiet? I’ve fucking hardly shut up.” “And what’ve you said?” “What have I said? As soon as we left the hotel, I said I wished I’d grabbed a pain au chocolat from the breakfast buffet, cos I usually get hungry about 11. You said fuck all back. One-nil to me straight away.” “Then we passed Darren’s Bar. I said we should take a photograph and send it to Darren, cheer him up a bit cos he’s having a hard time. Not that you would give a fuck. Different if it was one of your pals. And then…” “And then on the promenade, the guy on the Segway came past us and I told you the guy who invented the Segway apparently died by segwaying off a cliff. That is a strong conversation piece. I got fuck all.” “Then I told you how many people there’s ever been. Four-nil. A hundred and 18 billion. That is fascinating. What’s your name, mate? The guy with the Hugo? What’s your name? Owen. Again, a lot of originality in the names. Owen. Man, how old are you, Owen? Seventeen? A youngster. Wow. It’s good that I’m still getting the youth. Although, that is, er, scary. And age, it’s a number, innit? Don’t you worry. We’ve got a few older people in, but it’s subjective, age. I believe you’re young for as long as people laugh when you fall in public. You’re young. Right? In my opinion, that is the only accurate age for the aging process. Thank you. That’s… I learned this. I tripped over a curb and I tried to resist the momentum and I eventually hit the deck. And upon impact, I heard laughter and I looked over and there was a van full of workmen and one of them was even performing… …a full-on wanker sign, going, “Wa-hey!” And it was embarrassing, until I thought about it a bit\",\n",
       "  \" deeper and I thought, “No, Kev. Enjoy these moments. Enjoy this. Enjoy this, Kev, cos there’ll come a time when you’ll have a similar fall. You’ll hit the deck and you will not hear laughter. You will not see the wanker sign, or hear the wa-hey! You’ll hear, ‘OK, sir, what’s your name? Sir?’ ‘Sir, can you hear me? He’s not responding. Sir? I’m just gonna try and move you, sir, OK?'” That must be a terrifying moment for any senior figure, being forced to confront your own mortality in such a crass circumstance. So, next time you see an old person who’s fell, just… Just bear that in mind. Before you rush over there, asking for emergency contact details, just know there might be a young soul in that… Inside that decaying mammal, there may be a young soul. And if you rush over, that young soul could vanish forever. Whereas a wee… A wee wanker sign, wa-hey! Make that old man feel alive. “I wish I got that on video, mate. Wa-hey!” I’m noticing people in senior positions are younger than me for the first time. That’s a new one, innit? Politicians. Football managers are younger. Jesus. He was 33 when he died. That makes me feel old. Wow, Jesus would’ve been three years below me in school. Wow. I don’t know if I can worship him. He’s a wee guy, man. He’d have got put in a headlock. “Jesus!” “Turn that Capri-Sun into wine, Jesus, or you’re getting…” Running up behind him and kicking his sandals off from under his feet. But he was ripped, Jesus. I don’t think he gets enough credit for the shape he was in. Any time I’m in Mass and I just kind of daydream, it always strikes me when you see Jesus on the cross, he had a six-pack. He never touched the bread at that wedding. No way did he put starchy carbs in that wee welterweight frame of his. He’d be on Instagram if he came back, doing fitness tutorials. @JCPT, standing. “Only my da can judge me” tattoo. I like Jesus. You can have a laugh and you can joke about him. It’s good. He takes a joke, in my opinion. Doesn’t he? Cos people get upset at comedians these days, don’t they? People are always complaining about jokes. It happened to me. Cancel… Cancel culture is what they call it. I don’t know if anybody’s seen that I caused uproar last year. Me! I caused controversy. What had happened… I’ll tell you the story. What had happened was I had a show in Glasgow on the evening of the Queen’s death, right? Now, the story… I know I don’t need to explain myself in this part of the world, but… We’ll probably… We’ll probably get the editor to take that cheer out just in the interests of Anglo-Irish relations. I had a show on the evening of the Queen’s death, right? And what had happened, I will explain myself as a comedian, right? The Queen’s death was confirmed at 6:45 p.m. The doors to my show had opened at 6:30 p.m. Now, the show is going ahead, and as a stand-up comedian, you’ve got a few options there. You… You can either cancel the show, even though people are already in, or making their way there, then everybody would go fucking nuts, or you start the show and don’t mention a news story of that magnitude, which had just broke, which would be fucking weird if I just came out, “Has anybody seen the price of a KitKat Chunky these days?” Or you can start the show and make a couple of jokes about the situation and then move on as normal. Now, I chose option C. The show went ahead as a mark of respect to the hardworking people who had paid money and babysitters and hotels and all that stuff to come for a laugh. So I chose that option. And what I said was, “She hung on in there until the doors had opened. She would’ve wanted my show to go ahead.” Right? Which is funny. And then in a dig at the UK government and their handling of the energy price crisis at the time, that she wouldn’t be the only old woman to die in the coming months. Right? Which was fucking true and funny. And then I said the new head of state is King Charles, a wee dog. And that was it. We moved on. Everybody laughed. But somebody had recorded a video of me opening the show and uploaded it online and that’s where the problem starts. See, people who come to comedy shows tend to be sound. You come here for a laugh. You don’t come here for an evening of good points. “I hope I agree with this person. What a fucking night. I’ve never agreed so much in my life.” You come for a joke. But somebody recorded a video and put it online and then I began trending on Twitter. For those of you unfamiliar with Twitter parlance, trending means you’re in trouble. It’s like being out in the corridor and everybody’s going fucking nuts. And that’s when I realized that Twitter is the VAR for stand-up comedy. Cos everybody on the night laughed and then the jokes went to a Twitter VAR check and they were disallowed. That’s what happens at every comedy show in the world. There’s a check. There’ll be something this evening. There’s something every night. “I didn’t like it when he said cunt, because my mum’s a cunt.” There’s always something for these people. And… And, Owen, you’re 17. Owen, right? Your generation, you get the blame for being easily offended. That’s what we say. Snowflakes. That’s what they call your generation. I mean, I don’t blame them. I just try and move with the times, right? I know they’re a bit strange, aren’t they? You know what I mean? They’re a bit like… I don’t know. They make me feel older than I should feel. Like other new celebrities, YouTubers. I don’t know who people are until they’re fighting Floyd Mayweather. That’s a strange age to be. I’m saying, “Who’s Logan Paul?” “I don’t know, but a ten-year-old would put a knife through your windpipe for a bottle of his energy drink, so he’s done something right.” Fucking 25 quid for a bottle of juice. And then they’re chain-vaping their wee disposables, their wee Elf Bars. What happened to the youth is the big tobacco companies thought, “Not enough young people are smoking cigarettes, so why don’t we get a packet of Marlboro Red and a packet of Haribo Tangfastics and…” “…and empty them into a blender and get that liquid? We’ll put it in a wee heated element and take couple of puffs.” That’s what started the vaping. They’re a strange bunch, with their vapes and their bottles of Prime, and they’re always fucking whining about something. The youth of today are a strange bunch, and if Michael Jackson was still alive, he’d be saying, “I’m no’ sharing a bed with these fucking weirdos!” He’d be saying… Nah! He’d… He’d be saying, “Get me an adult in here for a decent conversation!” “Oh, it’s my anxiety.” “Shut the fuck up, shamone!” See, I don’t believe that they should… Even Covid, that was… The way children were represented during Covid, all that time that they missed off school. That was all you would see on the telly, the wee stressed-out dweebs complaining. “We are being robbed of our futures. Covid has stolen our education from us! We’ll never get this time back and we are the forsaken generation!” And that’s when I thought, “Fuck off!” Ther\",\n",
       "  \"e’s no way that was an accurate representation of every child’s attitude to such lengthy spells off school. Would it have been too much to have heard from the kids who hit the jackpot during that whole time? They never had to sit exams. Wow! What a time to be fucking stupid! Stick one of them on the telly. I bet some belters made it to university the past few years. Put them on the telly. Cheer people up a bit. “I was gonna do travel and tourism, but I got into medical school.” “It’s cos I’ve got emotional intelligence, everybody tells me!” That’s the new polite way of telling a child he’s a fucking dunce, innit? See, I’m trying. I try and keep… I don’t want to be a dinosaur, Owen. Right, I’ll tell you… I try and stay open-minded. I try and stay… I try and understand the generations behind me and all that. I try and stay woke. It’s just hard. It’s hard to keep up with the constant software updates. There’s always something new, like… I’m helping my mum. My mum is in the process of moving house, right, and we found a box in my mum’s loft. We’re clearing out all the old shit. Found a box full of my old school books and a bit of nostalgia got the better of me. I’m looking through all my old school books and on the front of one of the school books, there was graffiti. It said… This might be a bit Scottish, but I will translate. It said, “Your maw.” Right, you get that. It said, “Your maw’s got baws.” Right? Baws are balls. It said, “Your maw’s got baws and your da loves it.” Now this… This was a very common insult in Glasgow in the late ’90s, but I’m now reading it in 2023, thinking how this has aged beautifully into an empowering, uplifting message of self-acceptance. If I showed that to Owen’s generation, they would get fucking emotional. “Oh, my God. Isn’t that just beautiful what they wrote? ‘Your maw’s got baws and your da loves it.’ Your mother found the courage to embrace her true identity and your father was supportive. Beautiful.” See, that’s how woke a city Glasgow is. We don’t get enough credit for how open-minded and progressive we are. And sometimes, we don’t mean it. Sometimes it’s very subtle. Like, I was in a taxi in Glasgow and the taxi driver had recognized me and he was telling me how difficult it is to be a comedian. He’s telling me, right? He’s going… Right, every taxi driver in Glasgow is a savant. He’s going, “Must be hard, eh? Must be fucking hard being a comedian. You cannae joke about anything these days. You cannae say anything.” And then the conversation naturally led to the subject of Sam Smith and the driver… The driver said, “Sam Smith. Did you see what that cunt was wearing? Did you see what that cunt was wearing at the Brit Awards?” And I thought, “Bravo, driver, bravo. You have educated yourself. What a proud moment this is to hear such a progressive attitude.” Because in Glasgow, “that cunt” is a gender-neutral pronoun. I thought, “Bravo, driver. This has given me hope. If you had said, ‘Did you see what he was wearing at the Brit Awards?’, I would have stormed out of this taxi in disgust! I would’ve said, ‘Don’t you dare misgender that cunt! How dare you?'” There’s always been easily offended people and I will defend millennials like myself and the generation younger than me, cos 36 is a good vantage point to tell the youth what the older people used to be like. They were the original snowflakes. They were easily offended. And it’s summed up in a game that a lot of you probably played, the game called chap, door, runaway in Glasgow, er, knock… knock a door, run, knock-a-dally, knock down ginger, whatever it was called. The game has largely gone extinct, Owen. The game, it involved… You would come home from school. I’ll tell you the premise of the game, for those of you unfamiliar. You’d come home from school, you would change out of your school uniform and into your civilian wear and then you go and would meet up with your associates and you would patrol your neighborhood aimlessly. And then, at one stage in the evening, you’d play the game where you’d walk up to people’s houses and you would knock on the door and run away, confident in the knowledge that the man, always the man of the house, was gonna come to his door, expecting to greet somebody as the knock suggested. But instead, he would see you and your associates fleeing his property and laughing, and that would trigger a reaction so strong in that man that he would abandon whatever plans he had made for his evening, whatever he was gonna watch on the telly, whatever he was gonna eat for his tea, insignificant. The only thing on that man’s mind from that moment henceforth was hunting you and your associates down for as long as he deemed necessary. Now, that’s a fucking snowflake. You never damaged his door. You never entered his property. You knocked the door and ran away. Now for context, as a millennial, if somebody knocks on my door, I’ll look at my wife. My wife looks at me. We both look at our phones. “Did you just order some…? Are you waiting for somebody? Are you expecting anything? No. Same here. Let’s just stay calm and hopefully they will fuck off.” Or maybe one of us would tiptoe over to a window to get a visual on the door, stealth-like. And if there was nobody there, and I’d just seen kids running away, I would think, “Thank fuck!” I thought there was actually somebody at the door. I thought I was poised to have a human interaction there, an unplanned human… Who needs that shit on a Tuesday night in 2023? I was quite enjoying sitting on the couch in the basement of my mind. I thought I was gonna have to come up to reception to go live and greet somebody! I could only imagine saying to my wife, “I’m heading out there to hunt these wee bastards down.” Unthinkable! “Where’s my Trespass fleece, darling? I might be a while!” “I cannot be expected to show restraint in the face of such blatant provocation!” I could only imagine my wife on the phone to her mother, “A bunch of kids knocked on the door and ran away, so that’ll be Kevin for the night.” They’re the snowflakes! They were the real snowflakes, the older generations. I remember spending hours in exile, cos you’d knocked on the wrong door. Having to hide in bin sheds. The street lights would come on. Somebody in your platoon would eventually crack and start crying. “Do you think he’s still fucking coming for us?” “Just keep your voice down. He could be anywhere!” “I just really… I just want to go home. This has been hours. Why do youse always knock Harry McMaster’s door? You know he’s a loose cannon!” “Just fucking shut up!” “It’s all right for everybody else. I’m the one that needs to walk back past his door. He’s gonna get me on my own!” Children reduced to tears for knocking a door and running away. That’s a snowflake. Right, if that was me, I would just stand at my window and say to my wife, “Isn’t it great to see children out playing?” That’s how we handle that! Anyway! Ladies and gentlemen, what an audience! Er, what a venue!\",\n",
       "  ' What a city! Thanks for listening! Take care of yourselves. Thank you! Goodnight! Peace! Thank you! Thank you very much! Yes, thank you. That’s just a wee optional ending for any… for anybody who really needed a piss. Er… Thank you, genuinely. The warmth in here’s been amazing and it’s appreciated. So, thank you, people, yes! It’s er… I hope I finished on a nice message, a bit of hope for the young team there. Just trying to defend ’em, cos they’ve got a lot going on, haven’t they? We’ve got climate change and stuff like that. Every news story’s so intense, innit? And it’s quite hard. That’s a difficult one, if you’re Scottish or Irish, to really give a fuck! I know it’s a serious issue, but we’re only Scottish. We’re only Irish. It’s quite hard to have… It’s pretty low down on a list of immediate concerns, the planet getting warmer. Like, we even hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference. That was held in Glasgow in November 2021. Glasgow in November! That is a tough fucking crowd to spread alarm about the planet heating up! We had Greta shouting at us. “How dare you?” “What the fuck have we done? It’s fucking freezing!” “If we don’t act now, the planet’s gonna be two degrees warmer by 2050.” “Oh, no!” I might need to ditch a vest! In Scotland, we’ll reap the benefits of climate change. We’ll become, like, a resort when… Cos we love… We appreciate… We appreciate nice weather more than any country in the world, and maybe it’s time to switch it up a bit. Maybe nice weather has been wasted on too many countries. Well, like Iraq. Like Iraq. In my whole adult life, I’ve watched the news go live to Fallujah and it’s never a happy story. There’s a big blue sky. The reporter’s got a wee short-sleeve shirt on. He’s never reporting live from a pool party. He’s never… “So, Gordon, back to you in the studio.” Getting fucking, “Whoa!” It’s always misery. Oh. “Violent clashes here between Sunni and Shiites.” Come on, man. Religious violence in that heat. It’s too nice a day for that. Come on! Leave that to Scotland and Northern Ireland, man. Sectarian violence is a winter sport! Why do Catholics and Protestants hate each other? Because it’s fucking raining, that’s why! I’ve got hope. I’ve got hope for the youth. Like, I believe… Childhood, that’s what kids need to realize. When they’re suffering and they’re worried about stuff, but I think a lot of kids need to realize that life is long, right? It’s not about being a kid, right? For example, some people just don’t suit being certain ages. I was shite at being a kid. I was quite anxious and nervous, but then, my time came. I came good in the end, right? A school bully, for example. A school bully is just somebody who was good at being 15 when you look back at life. The youth, they’ve got it difficult. They get cyberbullied. We don’t know what that’s like to grow up online. At least… There’s always been bullying, but at least back in the day, the hours were better. It was only Monday to Friday, nine till three, excluding summer holidays, Christmas, Easter. It was a skive realistically in comparison to them. They can’t even play the PlayStation without getting abuse over the speakers, as I learned during lockdown. I bought myself a PlayStation, playing FIFA. I’m a bit rusty. I’m getting hammered by kids online and I’m playing Liverpool. I’m getting beat about five-nil, and then a Scouse accent starts blaring through the telly. The kid I’m playing wants me to quit the game because I’m boring him. I’m no’ giving him enough of a challenge. He’s going, “Fucking seriously, why are you still fucking here? You’re so shit. Just fucking quit the game, lad. You’re so fucking shit.” And the longer I played on, the more hostile the abuse became. “Seriously, lad, if you don’t fucking quit, I’m gonna find ya! I’m gonna slit your fucking throat, lad, when I find you.” And my wife walked in to ask me if I was all right! It took me straight back to school, like when my mum had witnessed me being picked on and you try and downplay it. I’m going, “Aye, I’m all right. He’s having a laugh. It’s my mate! Cos I threatened to slit his throat last night. That’s just our humor!” I look back and that’s what I will teach my son, that your time comes. If my son was ever being bullied, I’ll teach him a school bully is just somebody who was good at being 15, somebody who abused that power and everybody else was a work in progress. If my son was being bullied, I would take him to Ladbrokes. I’d take him to the bookie’s on a Friday afternoon. I’d take him to my old school bully. I’d say… I’d say, “We’re not gonna laugh at this guy, son. We’re gonna learn from this guy. That guy. See that guy that just punched the fruit machine? That guy. He was an amazing 15-year-old. Oh, he was the main man. If you were ever late for a class in school, you’d be sprinting down the corridor. He would be standing in the corridor shouting, ‘Run if you’re gay.’ And you would have to… Cos we lived under his regime and that’s the stuff that made you the man at being 15. But the problem is that life is not about being 15. And that is pretty much where we left that guy. One day, people just kept on running down that corridor. That’s where we left that guy. That’s what happens. Just get to know yourself. Your time will come. What was that, son? Ah, I never seen him swim. I don’t know, but that’s your man.” “Just get to know yourself. Be an individual.” Anyway, ladies and gentlemen of Cork, can I hear a massive round of applause for my wife Kerry and my mother Patricia who have traveled over to see the show this evening? And this is a… an emotional one. This is the first special that I’ve recorded without my dad being here. Those of you who maybe read my book know my dad took me to my first gig when I was 17 and we drove all round Scotland playing pubs to 15, 20 people, and I never believed it would come to selling out places and recording specials, but my dad did, and it’s a pleasure to prove him right. He passed away this year, so this is for my dad. To Big Andy Bridges! Thanks for listening. Take care of yourselves! Thank you! The craic has been mighty as always in Ireland. Take care! Thanks!

       " ['In her 2024 Netflix stand-up comedy special, “Have It All,” Taylor Tomlinson offers a sharp, witty exploration of modern life, relationships, and personal growth, all through her humorous and insightful lens. Tomlinson shares her journey towards understanding herself and the world around her, touching on everything from the flawed advice of married friends, the absurdities of dating apps, to the challenges of staying true to oneself in a world obsessed with appearances. Through personal anecdotes that range from a robbery that turned into a dating disaster to the trials of navigating single life and confronting her own insecurities and ambitions, Tomlinson crafts a narrative that’s both relatable and thought-provoking. Her reflections on the quest to “have it all” and the realization that true fulfillment might not come from societal achievements but from embracing one’s unique path resonate deeply, offering laughter and a subtle critique of contemporary culture’s fixation on perfection and external approval. * * * [crowd cheering] [“Boys Wanna Be Her” by Peaches playing] [rowdy electroclash rock music playing] [emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, Taylor Tomlinson! ♪ The boys wanna be her ♪ ♪ The girls wanna be her ♪ ♪ The boys wanna be her ♪ ♪ The girls wanna be her ♪ ♪ The boys wanna be her ♪ ♪ The girls wanna be her ♪ DC, how we doing? [cheering in response] How stupid was that? [audience laughing] I came up from the floor like I’m a fucking Jonas brother. I know that was silly, and it was my idea! I was so embarrassed that I thought of that, but it was too late when we got here to change it because men with jobs had built it. And were operating it very well, I might add. And I was like, “We can probably just scrap it, right?” They’re like, “Well, this is like a week of our lives, so…” I know that that was dumb. Thank you for indulging me. [chuckles] How we doing, DC? Thank you so much for coming. [audience cheering] I have to be honest, my career is going very well right now. I… [audience cheering] This is the last night of the biggest tour I’ve ever done. I am filming my third Netflix special tonight. And recently, someone was using my name and photos on a dating app. [audience wooing in response] It was me. I was doing it. Went through a breakup, got on a dating app. Why? Because my married friends told me to. If you’re single, your married friends don’t want you to be happy. They don’t. They want you on those apps because the apps look fun and they can’t go on ’em. So they want to stand behind you like a kid at an arcade with no fucking quarters, while you fight for your life out there. They’re like, “Go left, go right!” You’re like, “Do you wanna play?” They’re like, “More than anything.” “But I have the high score, so it wouldn’t be fair.” Your married friends don’t want more married friends. Nobody wants more married friends. Sorry if you’re married. I know you’re up front. Two-income household. Nobody wants more married friends, okay? ‘Cause your life updates are boring. I’m happy you’re settled. Good for you. Know who has fun life updates? Your single friends. We’re out there, making mistakes. Named Trevor, usually. Have you asked married friends what they did over the weekend? “What’d you guys do?” “I don’t know. Just woke up next to my soulmate… again.” [giggles] Ask your single friend, “What did you do this weekend?” They’re like, “I woke up in a shallow grave!” “Why are you proud of that? Did you have sex in a grave?” They’re like, “Why do you think we dug the grave?” Do you have that one single friend who thinks she’s hot and fun, but she’s actually just in constant danger all the time? Every time she tells you a dating story, you’re like, “Oh my God, okay.” “No, we’re not judging, but maybe just share your location with us indefinitely.” I have one friend like that. Every week she tells me the scariest stories I’ve ever heard in my life. “I had the hottest date Friday. I’m making out with this guy at a bar. So sexy. He’s like, ‘Let me show you something.’ Pulls me into the back alley. Pulls out his huge… gun. Points it at my face. ‘Gimme your phone, keys, and wallet.’ Okay, kinky. I’ll try anything once.’ Right? He hits me in the head. I wake up 30 minutes later in a puddle. I hitchhike home. Oh my God, I am such a Samantha.” [audience laughs] We’re like, “We think you got mugged, babe.” She’s like, “Mugged? You’re such a prude. He’s gonna call me. He has my phone. You’ll meet him. He took my breath away.” We’re like, “No, he knocked the wind out of you.” Your friends say the dumbest shit when you go through a breakup. Trying to be helpful. Like, “Well, why don’t you just date yourself?” “‘Cause you told me not to settle. What the fuck?” “I can do better than me!” “Why can’t you just be single for a year?” “Why can’t you walk without headphones?” “‘Cause you’ll think about death the whole time. Exactly.” [audience laughs] This last breakup was different. This was the first breakup I’d gone through since I got on Netflix. And before I was on Netflix, my friends were very supportive. Like, “We’re so sorry. It’ll get better.” Then I got on Netflix and went through a breakup, and all my friends were like, “Well…” [audience chuckling] “I mean, you have your dream job, so…” My friends looked me in my sad face and went, “You can’t have it all, bitch.” All of them! And I was so offended. I thought about it, and I was like, “Know what?” “I don’t want anybody to have it all.” None of us do. It’s why they keep putting out Marilyn Monroe documentaries. They’re like, “She was pretty sad.” And we’re like, “Yeah, she fucking was.” Nobody wants anybody to have it all. If someone has their soulmate, you don’t want them to have their dream job too. If someone has their dream job, they don’t get to be in love on top. If someone has their dream job and their soulmate, bare minimum, their parents better be divorced. I’d prefer they were an orphan. [audience laughs] Nobody wants anybody to have it all. When I was a kid, I didn’t think you could. I thought you either got to be hot or ',\n",
       "  'have a good personality. I thought that’s how we’re divided. I thought life was fair. That got me through a lot of ugly years as a child. “It’s okay that I’m not more symmetrical.” “I have this great personality that will surely reveal itself any day now.” “It’s coming with my period and my Hogwarts letter. I can feel it.” That got me to sixth grade, when I met my friend Krista, and she was pretty, funny, smart, and nice. And that’s when I stopped believing in God. [audience laughs] But so many friends said a version of this to me after my last breakup that I started to feel really guilty. Because you know what, DC? This is my dream job. I can’t believe I’m filming my third Netflix special tonight. I cannot believe it. [audience cheering] I have been so insanely lucky in my career. And the more I thought about that, I was like, “Nobody has every single thing going for them as a person. You have been so blessed. Be grateful for what you have. Focus on that. Nobody gets to have it all.” And then I saw Hugh Jackman in person. [audience laughs] I was like, “I guess you can have it all. But there’s none left because ‘God’ gave it all to Hugh.” Hugh Jackman is a perfect specimen of a human man. Seeing him in person was a religious experience. It changed me. It was like seeing the Grand Canyon. Everyone should do it before they die. He is a wonder of the world, that man. It was like seeing Niagara Falls. You can bring the whole family. You get a little wet, but it’s fun. It was… [laughter, applause] Here’s what happened. About a year and a half ago, we were in New York, doing shows on tour. We had an off night in between theater shows. So me, my buddy Dustin, and his wife, Melissa, and a few friends, who were also happy, went to go see The Music Man on Broadway, starring Hugh Jackman. Was it a good show? I don’t know. But Hugh Jackman was there the whole time. They should’ve called the show, “We got Hugh Jackman in a room. Who wants to see him?” The show was great. At the end, they’re doing curtain calls. The actors are taking their bows. One of the actors steps forward and goes, “You’ve come on a special week, Tonight we’re raising money for an amazing charity called Broadway Cares. Tonight Hugh is gonna sign the pair of gloves he wore in the show. We’re gonna auction them to the highest bidder.” And I looked at my friends, and I was like, “I mean… I have money.” They were like, “This is what you’re gonna spend the Netflix money on?” And I was like, “Well, I don’t have a family.” [audience laughs] “There’s no one else here, and I’ve already had braces. If I can’t have it all, I’m gonna have those gloves.” Also, I thought it’d be hilarious as a bit. Because everybody asks you when you get on television, “What’d you spend that money on? A new jacket? A new car?” And I’m like, “How funny would it be if my first big TV purchase was a pair of sweaty gloves worn by Wolverine,” right? [chuckles] It’s like, what am I, a man? So dumb. I start competing in the auction, and I’m doing pretty well. ‘Cause I got nothing to lose and no one to live for. I’m doing so well, it gets down to me and two other bidders. It gets down to me, an older woman towards the front, and I kid you not, Jake from State Farm. That is 100% true, that detail, and I hesitate to include it because it makes the story sound like a dream I had once. “So in the dream, I’m trying to get Hugh’s gloves. Jake from State Farm thinks he’s gonna get ’em. Fat chance, commercial boy. Those are mine.” “Then Flo from Progressive rides in on a horse for some reason.” “Whoops, who’s that?” “Tony the Tiger pops a wheelie on his motorbike.” “All-cash offer.” “You can’t beat Tony. That’s old money.” So it is now me, this woman, and Jake. I think what happened next was Jake could tell that me and this woman needed the win more than he did. So like a good neighbor, State Farm backs out. Yep. It is now me and this woman. We are ping-ponging, back and forth. I think I blacked out because when I came to, we were at a number that I’ve not agreed to pay since college. So exactly like college, I’m like, “This is crazy. I’m not gonna finish.” [audience laughing] As they’re about to say, “Once, twice, sold to the woman in front,” Hugh Jackman steps forward, stops the auctioneer, and goes, “Before we end the auction, I just have to say, I am so moved by the generosity of tonight’s audience. You know, I have two gloves. If I were to sign both of them, would these two ladies match each other’s bid?” And he looked right at me. Now, I’ve never paid for sex… [audience laughing] …but I did drop seven grand on eye contact with Hugh Jackman. [audience laughing, clapping] [cheering subsides] Thank you for clapping. That joke was expensive. [audience laughs] They’re like, “It’s a tax write-off.” I’m like, “Don’t worry. I will make sure that it is.” I wish I could tell you I was like, “It’s for charity.” But the truth is, I completely forgot till the end. Even then, I was barely listening. I was busy talking to the glove. Like, “Hugh’s fingers were inside you. What was that like?” “He’s surprisingly gentle.” “I knew it.” I love that story ’cause I can always tell who grew up in church based on who starts laughing at “You know, I have two.” You’re like, “Oh, I read the Bible. I know when they’re about to cut a baby in half.” I don’t think the dating app thing is for me, by the way. Don’t think I can do it. Is anyone in here on dating apps? [light applause, whooping] Okay, has anyone in here never been on a dating app? [louder whooping] I don’t care for that. Wish I hadn’t asked. The smugness of those whoos. I hated every second of that. If you’ve never been, let me tell you what it’s like. Every dating app profile, you get six photos of what look like six different human beings. Then you go and sit in a coffee shop and wait for him. Like, “Come on, picture number three. Come on, picture number three.” And then he gets there, and you’re like, “Goddammit, it’s four.” But you can’t just leave. You gotta sit there for 45 minutes, nodding and smiling, knowing you’r',\n",
       "  'e gonna ghost him later. You feel creepy. You feel like Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Just like, “Oh, he doesn’t know he’s dead yet.” [audience laughing] Dating is so awkward, especially dating apps. A dating app date is not a blind date, but it is a nearsighted one, you know? The first date’s easy. You get dinner, drinks. That’s basic. But then they’re like, “This was fun. We should hang again. What should we do?” You’re like, “Well, shit. I’m not a person with hobbies or interests. I’m basically just a stack of frightened possums in a trench coat, doing an impression of someone I saw on the street eight years ago. So then you gotta go home and get online like a loser. Date Ideas, 2023.” We could bowl. Ever drive past a bowling alley? “How do these stay open?” Second dates, that’s how. We could bowl or mini golf. Is laser tag a real thing? You’re just doing shit church youth groups do when they’re trying not to touch each other. Just, “Lace up those bowling shoes, my man. You’re either gonna commit to me or Christ tonight. Can’t finger these holes. You can finger those. Pick your ball. Pick your ball.” I’m an introvert, and I think that’s why dating’s harder. Extroverts are better. You like getting to know people. You’re into it for some reason. That’s why you’re better at casual sex. When you think about it, a one-night stand is meeting someone as hard as you possibly can. I’ve never been able to have casual sex as an introvert. I can’t relate to my male comic friends in green rooms when they’re talking shop about road sex. “Yeah, I had sex with this girl and then lost interest after I came.” I’m like, “Totally. That’s how I feel after I poop in a Barnes & Noble.” Right? ‘Cause it’s like, “I got what I came for. We can go.” Those are my most fun friends to talk to. My friends who have casual sex regularly, I always want to hear their updates. I have a friend on Tinder. I call her every Monday. “How was your weekend?” She goes, “Great. Remember that guy I told you about? He is so good at dirty talk, Taylor.” I’m like, “What’s good dirty talk, in your opinion?” She goes, “I really like being called a slut and a whore.” I’m like, “Oh my God.” “If you like being called a slut and a whore in bed, your parents loved you so much.” Dirty talk is hot because it’s shit you’ve never heard before. Ooh! If someone called me a whore in bed, I’d be like, “Excuse me? That’s what my father calls me. That is a family name. Boundaries, sir. Look around. Is this sex or Thanksgiving?” Read the room. I wanna hear shit in bed I’ve never heard. I wanna hear like, “Hey. I set up a college fund for you.” [audience laughing] “I think your arms look too thin. I really enjoyed your Netflix special.” I have some daddy issues. I’m working on ’em. In therapy. Not in my relationships, not anymore. I used to put my dad and ex-boyfriends in the same group text and write in all-caps, “I don’t feel pretty today. Whose fault do we think that is?” [audience member] Yeah! “Discuss.” [audience laughs] That worked better than it usually does. I’m worried about you guys. [audience laughs] That one’s usually for me. Are we all right? I really like you guys. You guys are great. [audience laughing, cheering] Another friend is such an extrovert, she’s gonna have a threesome with a guy she’s dating. I was like, “Really?” She goes, “Yeah. Would you?” I was like, “God, no.” I don’t even want to hang out with two other people. I’ve never been in the middle seat on a flight, fighting for an armrest, like, “Wish we were all naked. That would be cool.” [audience laughing] I don’t think I could date an extrovert again. I dated an extrovert once. We moved in together. The first week, he’s like, “Hey, what if we had some people over?” I was like, “Look, if you don’t wanna be with me, just say so. You want to have people over? Over what? My dead body?” If you’re an extrovert in love with an introvert, you gotta understand, asking us to invite people over is like asking us to do anal. Watch our face change. Like, “I’m sorry. Is it your birthday?” Seems like a big ask for a random Tuesday. I live alone now. It’s incredible. I fall asleep in the middle of the bed like a boy king. “Good night, Joffrey.” It’s fantastic. I eat all the food I buy. Every grocery goes in me or it goes bad. That’s power, DC. Yeah. If I clog the toilet at home, I don’t have to deal with it right away. That’s freedom, DC. When I lived with a man I was attracted to, I was like, “Please, toilet. Don’t tell him I’m a human woman. I beg of you, take my dark secrets to your watery grave. Remember our bargain!” Now I’m like, “You loser toilet, that’s what lids are for! You wanna see the sky? Do your job.” [audience laughing] I was so afraid of being single all throughout my twenties. I was terrified of being single. I used to jump from relationship to relationship. ‘Cause I was so scared that I was gonna die alone. Now that I’m older, I’m like, “I’m not gonna die alone.” I don’t go hiking by myself, all right? Someone will be there when I die. A doctor, a murderer, someone will bear witness. I’ve been single for the last year now, and it has been the most relaxing year of my entire life. [audience cheers] It has been lovely. Waking up every day going, “Oh, no one’s gonna make me cry today but me.” The peace, it’s lovely. Here’s the thing. Being single is not what sucks. Dating is what sucks, and you can opt out of that. Dating is what’s shitty. The constant push and pull of hope and disappointment. Dating feels like being a stuffed animal in a claw machine. Like, “Oh my God! It’s happening! No, it’s not. Oh my God, here we go. Can’t believe I told people! That’s embarrassing.” [Tomlinson tutting] “You’re moving me over to get to something else. I understand. I get that.” Things change so quickly as you’re getting older. I had a friend. I didn’t talk to her for a couple weeks. I called to catch up. She goes, “You’ll never guess. I think I met my soulmate on Bumble.” Gone, just like that. They’re getting married this spring. We were lying in the same pile ',\n",
       "  \"of stuffed animals for years. I closed my eyes, and when I open ’em, she was outside the glass going, “It’ll happen for you too!” [audience laughing] [Tomlinson exhales] I love being the neutral friend who’s not dating because as you get closer to 30, breakups get more and more devastating. Half my friends are engaged, half are going through the worst breakup with the person they were gonna die with. Which means half the calls I get are, “I’m getting married,” and the other half are, “I’m getting old!” And I’m like, “I am getting Taco Bell. Who wants something?” Taco Bell, good for every occasion. Nothing’ll make you more grateful to be single than watching your friend go through a devastating breakup. That’s messed up to say, but it’s the truth. I have a friend who went through a breakup still follows her ex on social media. They’re trying to be mature and evolved. Rookie mistake. Her ex just posted a photo of him and his new girlfriend, who is a model. [audience winces] Don’t worry. We all called her. We’re like, “Hey, how’s it going? Have you been online today? Because we were thinking of maybe doing a no-screens day. We were thinking maybe we just power down, get a quilt, find a field. Maybe crack the Bible open one more time. I don’t know.” She’s like, “I already saw it.” We’re like, “Oh, we’re too late. Okay. Um, are you okay?” She’s like, “No, honestly, I wish he was just dating a man instead.” We’re like, “Oh, you are so problematic, Trish. Why would that be better for you if he was dating a man instead?” She goes, “No, listen. ‘Cause if he dumped me for a man, it would be like, ‘Well, okay, then he just wanted something that I could never be.'” We were like, “Well, yeah. I mean, that’s kinda… well… Right?” “No, no, no! No! No. No. No, you’re so pretty, babe.” “But like a model? That’s kind of like a different…” “Look around. Don’t you think if you were a model, we’d all be models? Like, this isn’t model squad. This is personality squad. Like, this is a different… team you’re on.” We have another friend who got cheated on, which is crazy. You can’t cheat anymore. It’s not the ’90s, you idiot! Your phone is tracking your every movement. You’re going to get caught. You’re gonna buy your side chick flowers. Your wife’s gonna get a text from Bank of America. Like, “We noticed that Steve was being thoughtful?” [audience laughs] “That just seemed like suspicious activity… over here at BoA, ’cause we know that POS.” [audience laughs] It’s important to hang out with married friends if you are the single one. You play an important role in their lives. I love to third-wheel my married friends, go to dinner, see a movie. ‘Cause I love when they walk up to meet me in front of the restaurant and I can tell that they’ve been fighting in the car. [audience laughs] Married people think you hide it so well. You’re just like, “Let’s just table it till later and have a nice evening.” Then you come in real sweaty. [in stilted tone] “Hey. Good to see you. Glad we’re finally doing this. Did they bring bread? The bread should’ve beat us here.” “Hey, can we get some bread, please? Can we get something to do with our hands other than attack each other, please? How are you? Tell us about you. Don’t make me look at her. Don’t make me look at her.” That’s when you, as a single friend, tell your married friends about dating. You get to tell them about the ghosting, the catfishing, and the deepfake AI porn. And you know, they get back in the car a few hours later like… [shaky, relieved sigh] “I don’t say this enough, but I’m grateful for you.” [audience laughing] Hang out with your married friends, go to their barbeque. “I’d love to come. What can I bring? Ice? Dessert? Perspective?” Want to know the best part about being single? The best part, hands down, is that you do not have to introduce anybody to your parents. Have you guys introduced people to your parents? It’s not about introducing people you love to one another. Is it? No! It’s about showing your partner why you’re mean to them sometimes. [audience laughing] It’s about taking your sexual partner back to the scene of the crime. To say, “See? The stories are true.” You don’t want your partner to like your parents. You want them to walk out of that night going, “Oh my God. Your parents are just…” “I know. I know.” “Seriously, babe. How did you ever…?” “I don’t know. I don’t know. Kinda seems like people should cut me some slack when I’m being a bitch, though, huh?” [audience laughing, whooping] “Kinda seems like maybe now that we have all the information, turns out I could be a lot crazier if I wanted. But I keep a lid on it pretty good, and… I deserve to stop at Target on the way home. With no time limit. And I want a cart. Not a basket.” Be careful when you introduce people to your parents. Your parents don’t always show up as your parents, do they? Mine never did. My parents undermined me every time I brought someone to meet them. I did everything right. I did the huddle in the car before. “Hey, remember, those people in there, they’re not your friends. Whatever they say, do not take that personally. It’s not you. It’s them. You want to write that on your hand? You can look at my tattoo if you get scared. Let’s do it.” Then you go inside, prepared for your parents to show their true colors, and your parents float downstairs. And they’re just amazing all night. They’re fun, cool, laid-back. Your dad’s in an open Hawaiian shirt. Just a one-man conga line, topping off drinks. Saying all kinds of progressive shit you’ve never heard him say. “You want another beer? We should golf sometime. What are your pronouns again?” [mouthing] What the fuck? And you gotta get back in the car later, muttering like a conspiracy theorist. “That was not… and I was there, and I know what happened, and it was right there. No one can tell me what didn’t happen, and I know about everything.” [Tomlinson muttering] Your boyfriend buckles up, like, “I don’t know, babe. Your parents are awesome.” And you’re like, “Ugh. No, they are not. I don’t know who those liz\",\n",
       "  'ard people were, but they are not the ones who broke me.” The next time you see your parents, they’re all smug, like, “Jason seemed to like us.” You’re like, “I know what you’re doing.” “Maybe your therapist wants to meet us. Get our side of the story.” “I cannot wait till you’re in the ground.” “All right, well, we’d like to be cremated.” “I will scatter your ashes where God can’t find them!” [audience laughing] “I will see you both at Easter.” Therapy gets better when you’re single too ’cause you have time to dig into things like that. When you’re in a relationship, you waste half of every session going over all the shit your partner won’t go to therapy for. When you’re single, that’s an hour of you every week. It’s almost too much time. You gotta start doing your homework. After my last breakup, I was coming into therapy hot every week with ideas. “You know what I realized this week? The elementary school I went to? Across the street from a cemetery.” And she’s like, “Okay. And…?” I’m like, “I don’t know, but that seems like something, doesn’t it? I bring the ingredients. You bake the cake. I’m not a doctor. I went down deep inside me, found something scary, brought it back up to you. I was so brave. Where’s my treat?” [audience laughing] “So brave, favorite client!” I want to find out if I’m my therapist’s favorite client. You can’t ask. They won’t tell. I’ve tried. The only way I can think to figure this out is to get in touch with another one of her clients. And then me and that client plan to call her, over the weekend. Separately. At the exact same time… suicidal. [audience laughs, winces] And then we just see whose call she takes. We both wanna end it. Who you want to keep here, Dr. S? And then whoever wins, we go to the next set of clients. And we just kind of do brackets. Sort of like a March Sadness situation. [audience laughing] I’ve been working on anxiety in therapy. That’s been my focus for years. Anybody have anxiety? [audience cheers] Anybody struggle with panic attacks? [audience cheers] Has anyone ever gone to the emergency room for anxiety or panic attacks? A few of us! What did we think was happening? Heart attack? Yeah. You get there, and they’re like, “It’s actually your mind attacking you.” I’ll make you feel better. I went to the ER once because I fell asleep in AirPods. Woke up, couldn’t find one. Thought I swallowed it. [audience laughing] “You meant you drove halfway there and turned around ’cause it was silly?” Nope. Went the whole way. Got seen. I wish I could pretend this story happened a really long time ago, but the technology involved makes that impossible. I’ve always had a lot of trouble sleeping my entire life. And before AirPods came out, I would fall asleep in regular headphones, listening to a podcast or a movie, something to calm me down. Before AirPods came out, headphones had cords on them. So if you swallowed one, you’d pull it out like a magician scarf. They came out with AirPods. I started falling asleep in those. So a few years ago, doesn’t matter how many, I fell asleep in two AirPods, woke up in one AirPod, and was like, “Well, obviously, I swallowed it.” Like a baby or a dog. Convinced my sister to take me to the emergency room, ruining Christmas morning for everyone. [audience laughing] We get to the emergency room in our hometown, where I have to tell three grown women at the front desk what I’m doing there. I’m like, “You probably get this all the time.” “But it would seem that I may have inadvertently in my sleepy-sleeps swallowed an AirPod?” And they were like… [stifling laughter] “An AirPod? Sweetie, those are pretty big.” “Those are big.” “You think you could have swallowed…” I said, “How about we don’t have a team discussion about what I can and can’t swallow, okay?” [audience laughing] They’re like, “Someone was ugly in middle school. We’ll take you back.” So, they take me back. We’re waiting for a doctor. I don’t know what I thought a doctor was gonna do if I had, in fact, swallowed an AirPod. They’re not gonna perform surgery. They’re gonna go, “Yeah, it’s in there.” “Well, stop at Taco Bell on the way home. Good luck.” Taco Bell, good for every occasion. I don’t know what I thought the AirPod was gonna do to me damage-wise. I’m like, what if it’s still charged? What if it electrocutes my intestines? Or starts playing Glee covers and everyone can hear? My sister’s like, “You deleted them all.” “Not all of them. Some of them are bangers!” Before a doctor can come in to see us, my other sister calls us from home and goes, “Hey, yeah. We found it in the pillowcase.” “Does crazy want to come home and have pancakes now?” I’m so embarrassed. I want to sneak out the back as quickly as possible. I’m like, “Let’s just go.” My sister’s like, “They’re gonna think something bad happened.” I was like, “Something bad did. Let’s go!” She’s like, “That’s an emergency exit.” I’m like, “It’s an emergency room. It’s a regular exit. Let’s leave!” Here’s my problem with the emergency room. When you are having an anxiety or panic attack, it is your only option. Which is why I think they need a second option next door called “the Anxiety Room.” All right? So you have the ER and the AR. The ER is where you go when you’ve been shot, stabbed. You’re actively bleeding. You fill out all that paperwork ’cause that seems like the time to do it. And then the AR is where you go when you’re like, “I don’t know where the bad is, but it’s in me somewhere.” “It’s either cancer or the devil, but I have to get it out.” And that is just one fill-in-the-blank form that says, “I know that it is probably fine, but…” [audience laughing] “My bones feel itchy. I don’t know!” “I just need someone in a white coat to tell me I’m stupid.” I know I mentioned during that joke I have trouble sleeping. Please, for the love of God, do not DM me articles after this show. I know you mean well, but I promise you I’ve read every sleep article out there. “Three ways how to sleep better!” It is the same recycled tips over and over and over. “Get a light lavender mist to ',\n",
       "  \"spray on the cold side of your pillow at twilight.” What am I, a witch? “Make sure it’s really dark and quiet in your room at night.” “Oh my God, it’s supposed to be dark? I’m such a dumb bitch.” “I’ve been sleeping under a disco ball. Because vibes.” “I didn’t know!” “Okay. Dark, quiet, check. Fixed!” “Why not leave your cell phone in a different room at night?” “Why don’t you put your baby outside?” [audience laughing] [audience cheering] This is not to say that I’m against sleep advice. I’m just jaded. I think I feel about sleep tips the way a lot of men feel about porn. Where I’m like, “No, I’ve seen all the basic stuff.” “Send me something weird.” I’m gonna ask this question. Let me preface this. It’s okay if nobody has an answer. I ask every audience every night. It’s nothing weird. If you think that you have a weird sleep tip I’ve never heard of… I’ve read every article, listened to every podcast, seen a lot of TikToks. I ask this question to every audience, every night of this tour. If you think you have a weird sleep tip that I have never ever heard of, raise your hand and tell me what that is. That being said, if anybody goes, “Have you tried the Calm meditation app?” I will have you removed. [audience laughing] It’s okay if no one has one. Does anyone have one? We got a confident one right here. What have you got? [audience member 1] Masturbate. Masturbate? Bitch, please. You think I haven’t tried masturbating? I don’t go to sleep. I come to sleep. Next. [audience laughing, cheering] All right. What else we got? Thanks for playing. What have you got? [no audible reply] There’s two things? And I do them in order? Okay. [audience member 2] You have to do a handstand. I have to do a handstand against the wall? Okay. Yoga, no. This sounds like I need to be hotter for this. I can’t. Well, all right. I just want to hear the end. So you do a handstand against the wall. Just a couple seconds. Just for a couple seconds. Just easy, breezy, beautiful cover girl. This is how hot people talk. They’re like, “Just do a handstand for 10 seconds. It’s no big deal.” You’re like, “Some of us are top-heavy.” All right, anyway. Sorry, go ahead. You need to be upside down. And then you sleep upside down. I haven’t heard the handstand part, but I have heard sleep upside down. ‘Cause it changes the bed, yeah. It confuses your body. Yeah, confuse yourself to sleep. Okay. That’s one. I’ve half-heard that one. Okay, so we’ll half give it to you. Anybody else think they have a weird one? Really weird. It’s okay if nobody does. I’m just curious. Who said “Whoo”? [audience member 3] Whoo! All right, what do you got? Listen to him talk. Listen to who? This guy. Listen to the guy you’re with talk? Are you trying to get left? Or are you trying to offload your partner right now? You’re like, “This one’s available.” “He just talks and talks. You fall asleep eventually.” “This dude right here.” Wow, okay. That was fun. We all stepped in a divorce. Wasn’t that a good time? That’s the first time that’s happened when I ask that. Every night, never one of those. “Take this boring piece of shit home.” [audience laughing] All right. Last one. What you got? [audience member 4] Listen to someone’s random phone calls in the other room. I listen to my mom have a conversation with my grandma… You eavesdrop on somebody’s… phone conversation from the other room? You listen to your mom talk to your grandma? Did you miss the whole part where I said I am alone? [audience laughs] At least the last girl offered me someone. “Have you tried falling asleep to the sound of people who love you in the other room?” I would that I could! Okay, well, those hurt my feelings. I’m gonna tell you the best one I’ve heard on this tour. It was a few months ago. A woman in the front row. “I have a weird sleep tip.” I said, “What you got?” She goes, “When I can’t sleep, I lay on the floor in the kitchen for 10 minutes.” And I was like, “Okay. And then what happens?” She goes, “Then I get back in bed. I go to sleep.” This poor girl abusive-parents herself. She’s like, “Aw, you can’t sleep?” “You know some kids don’t have beds, right?” “Go lay face down on the cold tile for 10 minutes.” “See if you’re not more grateful after that.” And you know what? I tried it, and it works. It totally works. [audience laughing] I do it on the bathroom floor in hotel rooms. I’ve had COVID many times, but… I want to get a handle on my anxiety. ‘Cause if I didn’t have anxiety, I’d be totally different. The worrying alone takes up so much mental and emotional energy every day. It doesn’t help. It doesn’t prepare you for anything bad happening. I told my therapist recently, “I know worrying doesn’t do any good.” “What’s that quote by that philosopher? ‘When you worry, you just suffer twice.'” She goes, “Who said it?” I looked it up. It’s from a fucking Harry Potter prequel. [audience laughing] I was so confident, I Googled it in front of her. She’s like, “What philosopher said that?” I’m like, “Newt Scamander. Shit.” “Think it was a fortune cookie. Can we move on?” “I don’t want to talk about it anymore.” Without anxiety, I’d have a totally different personality because so many decisions I make in life are fear-based, or so many decisions I don’t make are fear-based. I watch the same shows and movies over and over because it calms me down. I know what to expect. I date the same type of person over and over ’cause I know what to expect. If you think you have a “type,” you don’t. You have anxiety. See someone. I have three younger siblings. They’re all Gen Z, they’re all queer, they’re all in serious relationships, and they’re all so disappointed in me every time I start dating another straight white guy. They’re like, “Come on, Taylor. Fuck the patriarchy.” I’m like, “You guys, I’m literally fucking the patriarchy.” Do you know how hard it is to continue dating straight men when you’re surrounded by three queer relationships up close? Queer relationships are the most beautiful, thoughtful, creative things I’ve ever seen in my life. My sister and her partn\",\n",
       "  \"er are in a romance novel. Every time I talk to them, I’m like, “I know you had a hard week. You okay?” She’s like, “Yeah. I did.” “To cheer me up, my partner got me my favorite snack in a limited edition flavor, they got me sand from the beach we went to on our first date, and you know how I always wanted an Easy-Bake Oven and never got it?” “They found one on eBay.” [audience laughs] I’m like, “Oh my God, are they cheating on you?” She’s like, “What? No! They listen to me and remember things I say.” I’m like, “What? No, go through their phone.” “This shit stinks. Go through their phone. Trust me.” She’s like, “Okay. How are you and your boyfriend doing, Taylor?” I’m like, “Oh, we’re good.” “My boyfriend bought me a hot dog because he wanted one and I was there too.” “It was so romantic.” “He was like, ‘What? Sorry. Two, I guess.'” I don’t mean to shit on straight guys. I’ve dated a lot of you. But you are so proud of yourselves for almost nothing in a relationship. It is impressive to watch. A straight man will put a candle in his bathroom and be like, “I’ve changed my whole life for you!” Then you’re like, “You didn’t even light it, man.” “It kind of smells like lavender if you get down real close.” “I’d trade this candle for a slice of empathy, if I’m being honest.” Have you tried to explain the concept of empathy to a tall, handsome white guy? That is a delicate conversation. You’re like, “Okay. Imagine that you’re me.” “But I’m not.” Okay. “Hard to argue. Touché.” “Imagine that you feel how I feel.” “But I don’t.” “Okay.” “Imagine that you could feel how I feel.” “I never will.” “Okay. Imagine you’re a basketball player.” “Okay.” [audience laughs] “What else? I like this game.” “Fine, in this analogy, you’re a basketball player.” “And you’re a really great teammate.” “You love your team. You do everything for your team.” “Your team is not noticing.” “Your team is not appreciating you for all you do, for the MVP that you are.” “And this week, your team forgot your birthday.” “Now, how does that make you feel?” “That sucks!” “Yes!” Trying to get a hot guy to empathize is like trying to get a woman to come. “Nobody move!” “We’re so close. It’s a car alarm.” “Stay focused, please.” “Worked so hard.” I’ve been trying to figure out if I’m bisexual or if I just binged Euphoria too fast. [audience laughing] I’ve been trying to date women, but I dunno how to get women to like me. I know how to get men to like me. Easy. You trick ’em. Just wait until they kind of like you, and then you’re like, “You don’t like me.” They’re like, “Yeah, I do.” “You don’t.” “Yeah, I do.” You’re like, “No, you don’t.” “I do!” You do that until they get you pregnant, I think. You just turn it into a fun challenge for ’em. “Bet you can’t spend your life with me.” They’re like, “Fucking watch me, you bitch!” Like when you ask a kid to take out the trash, and they’re like, “No!” And you’re like, “I’ll time you.” And he’s like… [gasps] “See? You didn’t even think you wanted to do that.” He’s like, “Who cares? I’m the fastest boy alive.” Hitting on women is so much harder. It feels so much more delicate. Hitting on a woman feels like trying to skip a stone on a lake. Hitting on a man feels like throwing a brick through a window. Like, “I don’t really care. I just want to see what happens.” “I’m not gonna live here.” I might be sexist. I’m hearing it now as I’m talking. I think I’m sexist because when a man rejects me, I’m like, “This idiot!” But when a woman rejects me, I’m like, “She knows what she’s talking about. Um…” I was talking to a friend of mine about it because you don’t wanna just… It’s scary to just say you’re bisexual ’cause then someone’s always like, “Prove it. Here’s a pic of Margot Robbie. Are you wet? Lemme feel.” Everyone’s really… Everyone’s aggressive about it. It’s weird. You’ve got to prove it to people. Uh, but I was asking my friend about it, and she goes, “Obviously, sexuality is a spectrum.” She watched Euphoria too. She goes, “I know that I’m straight. I could not go down on another girl.” “I think that’s gross.” I was like, “Okay. Let’s think about this.” “Why are you not going down on a girl now? Is it gross to you?” And I was like, “No, it’s not that it’s gross to me.” “It’s that I really don’t want to be bad at something as an adult.” My brother is trans, my sisters are gay, and I identify as afraid. I am so afraid of failure. I can’t even stick with new hobbies as an adult. How am I supposed to get good at… Getting good at going down on women would be like learning piano. I would love to have that skill. Bust that shit out at parties, impress everyone. But I don’t have the time or humility to sit down and learn new fingerings. I don’t have it. [laughter, applause] I get halfway through “Jingle Bells.” I’m like, “I suck.” “I should’ve started at 12. I’ll never catch up.” I already know how to play clarinet. It is not my passion, but I have the respect of my peers. I have many years of experience under my belt. Under someone’s belt, under some belts. When I was a kid, I didn’t know there was another option. They were like, “You’re a girl, play clarinet.” I was like, “What about piano? Could I play piano?” They’re like, “Sure, you can play piano if you want to go to fucking hell!” Anybody, religious trauma? [whooping] Do we have any of that in here? Okay. I’m sorry if you don’t have any. I know I’m a broken record. I should shut up about it, but I keep realizing new things. For example, did you know when you come, you’re not supposed to yell, “Take that, Jesus!” Did you know that? [laughter] I wish that was a joke, DC. I really do. Even if you didn’t grow up religious, a lot of people grew up sheltered. Round of applause, how many people did not get a sex talk? [audience clapping] Round of applause. Yeah, see? Now, round of applause, who did get a sex talk growing up? Who did get one? [audience cheering] You did. Do you mind me asking how old you were? Is it okay I’m talking to you? I want to make sure. If I talk to you and you’re not into it, that’s completely fine. I wou\",\n",
       "  'ldn’t talk to a live entertainer. Do you consent to crowd work? I need a verbal yes. Not just a thumbs up. Yes? See? Not that hard. That’s how it’s done. All right. All right. How old were you when you got the sex talk? [audience member] Nine. Nine? Okay. That seems a little early but also kind of okay. I don’t know how tall you were at nine. Right? Were you asking questions, or were your parents like, “It’s time”? My mom took me for a picnic in the garden. Your mom took you for a picnic in the garden? Fuck you so hard. Are you serious? Your mom took you to a picnic in the garden to tell you the horrors of sex. I’m sorry. I’m having an emotional reaction to that. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. This Secret Garden sex talk. Holy shit, okay. Wow, what’s that like, Lorelai Gilmore? Fuck me. So you weren’t asking questions or anything? Your mom was like, “It’s time…” Oh, you were asking questions? See, a lot of people ask questions. And I didn’t realize all these kids were so smart. I didn’t know we were supposed to be. I never asked any questions. Which is so stupid, now that I think about it. ‘Cause when I was a kid, before I got my period, I had three holes. I still do. I don’t know why I said it like that. I still do. For the record. Just for anybody watching… I’ve always have had, always will have. I think. When you get your tubes tied, do they seal it off? I’m gonna Google it. Forget this. This was a tangent. I’ll deal with this on my own. But before I got my period, I had three holes, and one of the holes wasn’t doing anything, right? And I never thought to ask anyone around me, “Hey, what’s this unemployed hole doing between my other two holes that are working pretty hard?” I just walked around all day like, “I don’t know. That’s my big one!” “God knows what he’s doing.” “That’s where my faith goes.” After I saw Music Man, I started calling it my glove compartment, but… that is another story. [laughter, applause] This was my sex talk. So when I was ten, I read what sex was in a book. Not planning on it. Just like, “Oh my God!” Tried to forget. Just assaulted by Judy Blume, quite frankly. Then two years later, my dad was driving me home, and out of nowhere, he goes, “Do you know what sex is?” I was like, “Yeah, I read it in a book. Let’s never speak again.” And he’s like, “All right, I need you to tell me what it is so I know you know.” My dad made me give him the sex talk! I was like, “Do you know what it is?” He’s like, “Tell me what you know. Then I’ll tell you what I know.” “And we’ll get to the bottom of this together.” I used to ask my parents for relationship advice every time I went through a breakup. Don’t. Unless you want to learn about your parents. I had a terrible breakup in my early twenties. I was home. My stepmom was trying to comfort me. She goes, “You know, there was a guy in my twenties I wanted to marry.” “When it didn’t work out, I was devastated.” I said, “I didn’t know this.” And my dad goes, “I did! She talks about him all the time.” And I was like, “Who was this guy? What was his deal?” She goes, “He was really cool, actually. He was an Alzheimer’s scientist.” And my dad goes, “Notice how that’s not cured yet.” [laughter] She’s like, “Wow, honey. I hope we never get Alzheimer’s.” He’s like, “I hope we do! So we can all forget about this guy.” I used to be way too loose with who I asked relationship advice from. People in the audience, total strangers. I asked a couple in the front row once. Two couples therapists who had married each other. I know. You ever see quadruple-stuffed Oreos? And you’re like, “Enough.” Right? That is a hat on a hat. It’s excessive. But I was like, “Two off-duty couples therapists.” “You gotta ask them.” I said, “Any advice for people in relationships who are fighting a lot?” They said, “We do.” “You know how a lot of people have a safe word to stop sex?” “Everyone needs to have a safe word during fights.” I asked a married friend, “Do you have a safe word for fights?” He was like, “What?” I’m like, “A word that stops the fight.” He goes, “We have one.” I said, “What is it?” He goes, “Cunt.” [audience laughing, wincing] “But I have to say it. It doesn’t really work if she says it.” I was like, “Jesus. I was looking for ‘pineapple, ‘ dude, but…” I used to ask for relationship advice after breakups because I thought that was me working on myself, but it really wasn’t. It was me figuring out how to get into another relationship, quickly as possible. So I wouldn’t have to work on myself. The reason people don’t want to be single for long is that once you’re single for a little bit, you start to notice, “Ooh, some of the issues in my relationships are still here.” And it’s just me now. There’s only one set of footprints in the sand. And no one’s carrying my ass. I realized in the last year I have a lot to work on. I realized I’m petty in relationships. I don’t wear perfume when I’m single. Don’t even think about it. I wear perfume in a relationship, though. Because I know if we break up and you smell that smell later, you’ll get sad. And that makes me happy. I don’t wear perfume to smell good. I wear it to haunt you later. I was on a first date with a guy. I realized we both had three younger siblings. I said, “Oh my God. Let’s text our sibling group chats.” “Ask them what our biggest flaw is.” I’m so fun on a first date. I can’t believe I’m alone. He texts his brothers, “Hey, what’s my biggest flaw?” They write back, “Works too hard.” “Cares too much.” One wrote back, “Dyslexic,” which I thought was pretty funny. He couldn’t read it, but I could. [audience laughs] I text my siblings, “Hey, guys. What’s my biggest flaw?” And my brother writes back immediately, “You expect everyone to hurt you, so you leave before they can.” I was like, “Dude, I’m on a date right now.” “Sorry! Works too hard!” “I thought this was a secure line!” I’m a very emotional person, very emotional partner. I’m run by my emotions. Did you know some people feel feelings privately? Have you guys heard about this compartmentalizing bullsh',\n",
       "  'it? Some people apparently have these polite little feelings that shuffle up to ’em during the day. Tug on their sleeve like, “Hello, excuse me?” “I need to be felt at some point, whenever you get a chance.” You’re like, “I’m at work now.” “You’re at work? I’m so sorry.” “Have time later?” “I get off at 6:00.” “Okay, like 6:30, do you have time to feel abandoned and worthless?” “Okay, 6:30 in the parking lot. It’s a date.” “I love you so much. You’re doing great at work. Bye.” That’s never happened to me. Every feeling I have demands to be felt immediately. Every feeling I have demands its own parade. Every feeling I have turns into that scene from Aladdin where he’s pretending to be a prince. Just like… ♪ OMG, Taylor’s hungry! ♪ ♪ This could get dicey ♪ ♪ Needs a sandwich now She’s a bitch, take it from me ♪ But I’m glad I’ve had this year to work on this stuff because I needed it. I turned 30 two weeks ago. [cheering] And that means… Thank you. And that means that I have spent the last 14 years of my life trying to get good at this, trying to get good at stand-up. Trying to have the career that I am now fortunate enough to have, thanks to all of you, honestly. Yeah. [cheering, applause] And as grateful as I am, and as lucky as I am, it has really made me, this year especially, go, “Oh no.” I don’t know if I’m gonna be good at this other stuff. I… I mean, I know I’m a good comedian. I don’t know if I’m a good person, a good parent, a good partner. This hour of material that I’m doing right now, that’s like, “Can I have it all? I don’t even know!” This is not a bit, DC. I am genuinely concerned. I know how hard it is to do this job in this business and have a family. I see how hard friends of mine work. I also see how little work people put into it. Lot of people in this business are like, “You can have kids and travel!” “They got FaceTime now.” Which feels like tying your dog outside a shop. “I can see him through the window. He’s okay.” I still have childhood shit I’m working through on my own. I don’t want to put that on a kid, right? Like, I was watching a TED Talk recently… Sorry, I was watching a TikTok recently. I always get those confused. The information’s still good. It’s just vertical. …that said, if you have childhood trauma you’re working through, you need to learn how to parent yourself as a grown-up. So I’ve been trying to do that to heal, trying to parent myself. But I feel like I got pregnant with me in high school. And I was not ready for this responsibility. And now I wake up every morning, totally overwhelmed, trying not to shake me. Like, okay… “If I let you watch TikTok on my phone for 30 minutes, will you please stop crying?!” My friends are like, “You okay?” I’m like, “No, I think I have colic. I kept me up all night.” I love TikTok. You know what’s funny about TikTok? These kids are like lip-syncing, dancing, pretending they’re in a music video. We all did that growing up, didn’t we? Yeah! Alone in your room in the mirror, hairbrush. Of course. But if anyone had walked in on you doing it, you would’ve killed yourself, right? [laughter, applause] And these kids are online like, “I hope millions of people see this.” It’s like, “You could benefit from some bullying, I think.” “Might’ve… overcorrected a bit.” I do have a lot of friends who are getting married and having kids. They’re… Look, they’re condescending as hell. It’s so funny how the same girls who used to wake up drunk on train tracks are like, “I dunno how you stay out past 10:00 p.m. Your lifestyle’s really unhealthy.” I’m like, “I’ve seen you snort coke off a rusty bike rack.” “But you keep sniffing that baby’s head like we all forgot.” But my friends who have kids and are married, they complain about their jobs, and I do the same dismissive thing right back to them where I’m like, “Yeah, but you’re married, so you’re fine.” They’re like, “But I’m miserable 60 hours of the week.” I’m like, “But you have your dream dick, so you’re fine.” And it’s not great, and I think part of it is that we’re all turning 30. And 30 was this age in our heads where, like… “Well, by 30, we’ll have all our shit together, right?” That kept us going through our twenties. “We’re 25, and we’re garbage, but in five years, we’ll have it all figured out.” Then, “I’m 27. I’m just a piece of shit, but I have three years to turn this around.” And then you’re like, “I’m 29. Crunch time, bitch!” And now that we’re all 30, we’re like, “Oh shit, our lives are not going exactly as we always pictured them.” And so now there’s this weird comparing that’s going on, this weird tension. Like, I know that all of my friends both pity and envy me. Just like I know that I both pity and envy them, right? I know my friends look at me and go, “I’d probably focus on work if I was all alone.” And I go, “I’d probably have a bunch of kids if I had no talent.” So we’re all… [laughter, applause] And it’s not healthy, per se. But I do think it’s good to focus on what is going right in your life. I think that that’s gratitude. I think that that’s important. It has gotten me through a lot of weddings and baby showers, to have my dream job, to sit in the back row like, “Whatever, have your bullshit love party.” “Hope it works out.” “I’m gonna have the coolest job of anybody you know.” And that was true until somebody married an astronaut. [audience laughs] And everybody’s so impressed. I guess astronaut beats everything. They’re like, “You’ve gotta admit, that’s the coolest.” And I’m like, “He’s got to wear a costume or he’ll die?” Fuck off. That’s a dumb job. “No. If I can’t breathe somewhere, I don’t go there, Dan.” “That’s just science.” Dan hasn’t even been to space. He just goes to work and “practices space.” That’s his job. They put him in a rollercoaster. “Don’t throw up.” He’s like, “You got it!” What a hero. [laughter] I’m not proud, but I told the girl that married him, “You better hope he never does go to space.” She goes, “Why? It’s dangerous?” I said, “No, ’cause he’s gonna cheat on you up there.” Oh, you don’t think astronauts are c',\n",
       "  'heating? They’re in space for months, floating. How long before one of them looks at each other like, “Hey, you know what we should try?” [laughter] “Houston, we have a problem. Not a big one. It’s medium.” “It’s not small or anything.” What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What happens on the moon never happened. We faked that landing. That’s a joke. We didn’t. There were no female astronauts back then. [laughter] But if any of the relationships in my twenties had worked out, I would not have my dream job. I would not have the career I’ve always wanted. I’ve had a lot of cool experiences this year as a result of being on my own. I finally got to do some shows in Europe in April, which was a dream come true. And because I was single, instead of taking someone I was dating, I took Courtney. Courtney’s been my best friend since we were 10. Twenty years, she’s seen me through everything. She saw me through depression in high school. She saw my first stand-up show ever. I called off an engagement a few years ago. She kept my wedding dress in her attic like it was Jumanji. I’m like, “Just put this where I can’t hear the drums.” She and I got to run around Europe, paying for shit with my dick joke money. It was awesome. [audience cheering] Yeah. And it was really special to have her on that trip with me. Because exactly a year before that, last, last April, I was alone in a green room in Colorado, pre-show. Post-some breakup. I got a call from Courtney. “I thought you were on vacation with your boyfriend.” She goes, “Yeah, we are, but I just wanted to check in.” “That’s so nice.” And I talked to her about me for like 10, 15 minutes. Finally, I was like, “You’re not saying anything about you and your trip.” “I mean, are you guys okay?” She goes, “Oh my God. Yes. Oh, yeah.” “No, we’re great. We’re great. We’re actually, um…” “We are actually engaged.” I was like, “What? Oh my God! Why did you ask about me at all?” She goes, “I just wanted to make sure you were in a place where you could hear it.” [audience laughing] It was so sweet and so hurtful. I… I have never felt so seen and so insulted in my whole life. Her fiancé was there the whole time. She’s like, “And then what else?” “She sounds stable. She sounds like she can handle it.” That’s how you know your best friend’s met the one, when you can no longer get them on the phone alone. You call them late, crying. Halfway, they’re like, “By the way, you don’t care that Todd’s been here the whole time, right?” You’re like, “No, I actually called to see if Todd thinks I have a yeast infection.” [through gritted teeth] “So glad Todd is available!” Don’t get me wrong. I love my best friend’s fiancé. He’s amazing. If he died, would a little part of me go, “Sleepover”? Of course! But I was touched that she was thinking about me and my mental health during her engagement that I went out on stage, and I said, “Before we start the show, can you guys do me a favor?” “Can we make a video for my best friend?” The crowd’s like, “Yeah!” Got my phone, put it on selfie mode. And I went, “One, two, three! Congratulations, Courtney!” Me and 2,000 people, yelling it for her. I got offstage that night, and I texted her the video. To say, “Hey, I love you. I’m so happy for you.” “And look at all these people who pay to see me!” “I’m doing just fine.” “I have one of Hugh Jackman’s gloves.” Thank you so much, DC. You were absolutely amazing. Thank you, guys. Seriously. [“Boys Wanna Be Her” playing] Thank you so, so much. You guys were fantastic. [audience cheering] Does anyone think they have a weird sleep tip? Super weird. Wow. We got a confident hand right here. What do you got? [faintly] Sleep in a different city! Sleep in a different city? Bitch, do you know what my job is? Sleep in a different city?! Know your audience. What else we got? That was not a strong start. Anybody else… have anything? It’s okay if nobody does. We do right here. [audience member] Get a very firm MaxCoil mattress. Get a very firm mattress. Okay, do we need to hear the instructions again? If you think you have a weird sleep tip that I have never heard of, raise your hand and tell me. If no one has anything, that’s completely fine. We have one hand over here. What have we got, glasses? [audience member in glasses] A cat plus Xanax. Cat and Xanax. If you think… that I don’t have Xanax, this is your first show with me. Okay. Well, if nobody else thinks… Look, it’s fine. Okay, what about here? Right here. Four-seven-eight rhythmic breathing. What is it? Four-seven-eight rhythmic breathing. Rhythmic breathing. Okay, you guys, I’m gonna be honest. Y’all shat the bed on this one. These were some basic answers. Um, and that’s okay. What? Did someone say, “read a book”? I’m gonna fuck you up after the show. Meet me in the parking lot. Read a book? Oh my God. Okay, right here. It’s crazy that people are getting more confident as they hear other people’s terrible answers. They’re like, “I can beat firm mattress, surely.” What have you got, second row? Vicks on your back. What’s on your back? Vicks. Vicks on your back? These are not good, you guys. Thank you for playing. All right. What? Last one. Stretch for five minutes. Stretch for five minutes?! I’m never coming back to this city again. Your email address will not be published.

Kevin is the NWA Texas Champion. David is about to make his ring debut. Pop, come on. It’s time for you to start thinking about what you’re gonna be. Now we all know Kerry’s my favorite, then Kev, then David then Mike, but the rankings can always change. Everyone can work their way up or down. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) KEVIN: Good. Hold it up a little higher. That’s it. Now push forward. Goddamn it, Mike! (ENGINE STARTS) FRITZ: Come on! Come on, David, I gotta take a dump. Hurry up in there, man. Mike, shut up!

(CLEARS THROAT) PAM: Oh, don’t you wanna ask me who to make it out to? KEVIN: Oh, yeah. Sure. It’s Pam. Pam. PAM: Mmmhmm. You’re supposed to say, “Nice to meet you, Pam.” Yeah, I’m sorry. Uh, it is nice to meet you, Pam. (CHUCKLES) It’s nice to meet you too, Kevin. Did you, uh, want my brother to sign? No, just you. Okay, then. (CLEARS THROAT) Your folks not teach you how to ask questions? Like what? Well, like, you know, “Who shall I make this out to?” Or, um, or… (BLOWS RASPBERRY) “Would you like to have a drink with me sometime, Pam?” Are you asking me out? Make me feel a little worse while you’re at it. No, no, no. Sorry, no, I, uh… I would love to go out with you, Pam. (CLEARS THROAT) Wasn’t that… Yeah, I just… I’ve just never been asked before. Oh. Well, hopefully, it will go well and then no one else will have the chance to ask you again. Yeah. BILL: Morning. Morning. BILL: David’s good. (CHUCKLES) David’s good. (BILL CHUCKLES) Got the Saturday ratings back. Highest numbers ever. And somebody called me from over at ESPN. They wanna offer us a national slot for Saturday nights. That’s great news. (BILL CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Break it down for me. Well, it’s good financial base. Uh, we’ll have ad revenue. Bigger and bigger names coming through. But if we perform and we have a World Heavyweight Champion in our roster, we could be the biggest promotion in wrestling. Oh, we’ll have a World Heavyweight Champion. I can promise you that. Let’s move forward. BILL: Okay. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) KEVIN: There you go. Thanks. Yeah, have a good one. Are you this famous everywhere? No, not everywhere. They’re not such big fans up in Missouri. Oh. That’s for sure. You travel a lot? Uh, yeah. Yeah. We go out on the road. But we don’t have to as much anymore, because our show is doing so well. (CHUCKLES) So, what do you want in life, Kevin Von Erich? More ribs. (PAM LAUGHS) I wanna be World Heavyweight Champion. Hmm. Well, can you just explain that to me ’cause ain’t it all just fake? Fake? There’s nothing fake about what we do. Okay. All right. All right. Not fake. Um… prearranged? Written? Look, you move up in any industry based on your performances, right? PAM: Mmmhmm. So a belt, like my Texas title, is really just a job promotion. The promoters keep you moving up if you do well. And if you reach the top, you become World Champ as a reward, because you’re the best based on your ability and on how the crowd responds to you. Is that all you want? No. Of course not. I wanna be with my family. You know, be with my brothers. Mmm, that’s sweet. What do you like to do with your brothers? Anything. I don’t know. Just being together, we can do anything. (INHALES SHARPLY) Hmm. What about you? Well, I wanna be a vet. I want kids. I want my own practice. I want a man who’s okay with that. Cool. So, would you be okay with that? Oh, damn right, I would. (PAM CHUCKLES) We could be one of those modern super couples. (PAM CHUCKLES) We can have our own ranch. Everyone could come live with us. All my brothers, their families. (CHUCKLING) Okay. You know, you have oldest brother syndrome. Yeah, you wanna take care of everyone. Maybe. I’m not the oldest though. When I was five, my big brother, Jack Jr., he died. Oh. Oh, my God. Kevin, I’m so sorry. I had no idea. Oh, it’s all right. I don’t really think about it. Not anymore. What was that like? I don’t know. It was strange. As a kid, he just, uh… He just wasn’t there to play with one day. So, I’m not the oldest. I must have the, uh… the second oldest brother syndrome. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (SIGHS SOFTLY) PAM: I’m so sorry. It’s a part of the family curse, I guess. What’s that? Oh, I’m just joking. What, you never heard of the curse of the Von Erichs? No. Really? No. Oh, it’s uh… it’s a silly story. Hmm? My dad changed his last name to Von Erich, which was my grandma’s last name. And I don’t know, I guess her family had all sorts of tragedy. So, when my brother died, people started saying that it was this curse. But I don’t believe in any of that. I know it was all just bad luck. Well, I don’t believe in curses, and I don’t believe in luck. I think we make our own luck. You’re lucky then. Kev. Hey, Pop. Get in here. Come in, son. Sit down. (CHUCKLES) Big news for you. I booked Harley Race to come to the Sportatorium. You are gonna fight the World Heavyweight Champion. No way. (CHUCKLES) You kidding me, Pop? Your first match will be a nontitle fight, but if you put a whooping on him and show the world who you are and what you can do, you will become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship and get your title shot. Pop, thank you. Thank you. I… I will make you so proud. I’ve dreamed of having that belt in this house my whole career but the NWA never gave me the chance I deserved. I got close many times, but they always robbed me at the last minute. So you have to take this opportunity. You can be the one to bring it home for us. Yes, sir. HARLEY: I am the fourtime World Heavyweight Champion. Me, Harley Race, the real World Heavyweight Champion. Not any of this plastic nonsense that you all parade around with out there. You have all these guys walking around talking loud about how they are the man. Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Tommy Rich, or one of your snotnosed Von Erich kids. Well, this belt is the only measure of who is the man. And that man is me. The World’s Heavyweight Champion, Harley Race. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to an exciting night of World Class Championship Wrestling on ESPN. Tonight we have a momentous main event, NWA World Heavyweight Champ Harley Race is in town to take on Texas Champion, Kevin Von Erich. (WCCW THEME MUSIC PLAYING) BILL: And here we go, folks. You can feel the excitement here at the world-famous Spo',\n",
       "  'rtatorium in downtown Dallas, Texas. As that man right there, local hero Kevin Von Erich faces his biggest challenge to date. Four-time World Champion, the indomitable Harley Race. What an occasion this is for Von Erich family. The 3,500 fans in the building and everyone watching at home as we are broadcasting in 62 countries around the world. All eyes are on this contest. Now this is a nontitle fight. The belt cannot change hands here, tonight. But it is a tremendous opportunity for Kevin. If he can win, he would become the number one contender. (CROWD CHEERING) BILL: And they lock up, Harley Race overpowering Kevin into the corner. And he delivers a big blow to the midsection, knocks the wind right out of him. Not a great start for the young man looking to make an impression here tonight. And a devastating shot to the lower back puts Kevin on the mat. He’s lining up a big shot and Kevin blocks it and returns a punch. Connects once. Twice. And three times. Hits Harley Race again pretty hard on that one. (GRUNTS) BILL: Kevin coming off the ropes with a clothesline. The champ doesn’t budge. Kevin again off the ropes. Oh, and he knocks him down. He knocks down the old oak tree, Harley Race, with a spectacular flying clothesline. But the champ is right back up. Shaking it off. Kevin goes straight into a bear hug. Looking for that bellytoback suplex. REFEREE: Hey, break it off. Break it off! BILL: Oh, and a low blow. Oh, I don’t think the Ref saw that. Kevin’s struggling now. A vicious tactic from Race who looks to get back on top in this contest. Let’s go for a ride, kid. BILL: Oh, and he… he tosses Kevin over the top rope. My goodness. Kevin crashes down on that concrete floor. Race, absolutely ruthless, gets Kevin in a suplex. Oh, no. I hope he doesn’t do it. And he does! Harley Race puts a standing suplex on Kevin Von Erich, directly onto the concrete floor. (CROWD BOOING) BILL: Kevin is down. This crowd is stunned. (GASPING) Kevin is not moving, folks. Kevin Von Erich is not moving. Harley Race gets back up to the ring. CROWD: (CHANTING) Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! REFEREE: One! Two! Three! (GROANS) HARLEY: Come on. Get up. REFEREE: Four! Five! Six! (GRUNTS) CROWD: (CHANTING) Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! REFEREE: Seven! Eight! BILL: He’s starting to step up. REFEREE: Nine! BILL: He’s starting to come up, slowly but surely. He crawls up. Kevin Von Erich. Unbelievable. What this man has been through. He’s seen it all. He’s Well, he’s self-sacrificed. He’s worked very, very hard, and here he is, back in the ring with Harley Race. (GROANS) BILL: Kick to the ribs. That has to do some damage. And this is why Harley Race is the most dominant champion of our time. Kevin’s gasping for air as Race gets him into yet another suplex. But Kevin spins out and a knee right in the jaw, knocking the champ flat on his back. He’s back in this match. And here he comes off the ropes. And a big splash. This could be it. CROWD: (CHANTING) One, two… BILL: One, two! (GROANS) BILL: And Race gouges Kevin’s eyes. The Ref cautioning, but he doesn’t wanna hear. Oh, and he throws the Ref out. And that’s it. Surely, he will be disqualified. (CROWD BOOING) (BELL DINGING) BILL: Yes, and there’s the bell, folks. The boos ring out. The fans did not want to see it end like this. RING ANNOUNCER: And the winner by disqualification, Kevin Von Erich. BILL: Oh, oh, here comes David Von Erich. (GRUNTING) Get out of here! Get out of here! I dare you to come back in! Harley Race, I dare you! (CROWD SCREAMING) Go on. Get out of here. You ain’t got no place here. (CROWD BOOING) KEVIN: Harley Race. (PANTING) You coward. You afraid I was gonna beat you so… (PANTING) Harley Race, tonight we showed you what we’re made of. All right? (CROWD CHEERING) You came into our building with our fans… And my brother here put a good old fashion Texas whooping on you. You are the past, my friend. We are the future of this sport. So, you keep on running, but everyone sees you. Oh, yeah. Everyone sees you. And we’ll catch you whether you’re man enough to stop back through Dallas or if we have to chase you down in Missouri. My brother here deserves his rematch and he will fight you anywhere, anytime for a fair shot at that NWA World Heavyweight title. (MUFFLED CHEERING IN BACKGROUND) (DOOR OPENS) You were long getting up. Yeah. I’ve just never hit the floor that hard before. You gotta take it and get up. Yeah, I know. He wasn’t supposed to throw me out the ring. Caught me off guard. There was nothing I could do. I physically… I just couldn’t move. This is how they test you. Did I do enough to get my rematch? Of course, you did. We’ll see. Those rat bastards will use any excuse they can to screw us over. But I’ll chase ’em. David. Great on the mic, son. Really great. We’ll get you out on the road, get you some more exposure. Okay. (DOOR OPENS) (CROWD CHEERING IN BACKGROUND) (DOOR CLOSES) Hey listen. Dad’s downplaying it ’cause he doesn’t wanna get your hopes up. But you were incredible out there. Why didn’t you let me talk? Well, you didn’t. You should’ve let me talk. Yeah, I’m sorry, Kev, I thought I was helping. (EXHALES) Hey, smile, man. You just beat the World Heavyweight Champion out there. COACH: All right, Kerry, let’s make this a big one. Ready? You all set? (GRUNTING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) In my judgement, what we are doing is preserving the principles and the quality of the Olympics, not destroying it. It is absolutely imperative that we and other nations who believe in freedom and who believe in human rights, let our voices be heard in an absolutely clear way and not add the imprimatur of approval to the Soviet Union and its government while they have 105,000 heavily armed invading forces in the freedom-loving, and innocent, and deeply religious country of Afghanistan. And I hope recognition of a grateful nation will at least partially make up for the sacrifice that you’ll have to make this summer in not going to Mosc',\n",
       "  'ow for the Summer Olympics. I can’t say at this moment what other nations will not go. Ours will not go. (GRUNTS) KERRY: Hi! Hey. Kerry. Welcome home, Kerry. I’m sorry it didn’t work out, Pop. Me too, son. DORIS: Hey. Hey, Ma. KEVIN: Hey. Hey, boys. Hi. Come here, man. Oh, Mikey. Look at you. Ready, set! Hike! (SCREAMING) FRITZ: You’re the fastest in the family, Kev. No one could ever catch you. You still got it, son. Gotta put him on his ass before he breaks past you, Kerry. Blue 82. Hut, hike! (GRUNTS) (FRITZ LAUGHS) That’s how you make a hit on someone. What? What? Come on! (WHISTLE BLOWS) Hut hike! (GROANS) FRITZ: You gotta dive for them, Mike. You gotta lay out for that. Come on, son. Hike! Oh, my God, look at that! That’s why you’re the best linebacker in the state, Kerry. Coach Royal called me from UT. He said, “Why is the best linebacker in the state watching from the stands?” Good job, son. Hey, Pam. Hmm? I can pour you some more… more lemonade or something. Sure, thanks, Mike. (SOFTLY) You keep a hold on her, son. She’s a good one. You put that down, someone else will pick it up. (SOFTLY) Yes, sir. Hey, I, uh… I saw the new show, Pop. It’s great. And I was real proud watching you fight Harley, Kev. KEVIN: Thanks, Kerry. Now, when’s the rematch? Uh, not sure yet. We just haven’t got the call. KERRY: Oh. I’m working on it. Hey, Ker, you see all the new camera angles? They’re cool, right? Yep. We’re talking about wrestling, not camera angles. Your brother fought the World Champion on national TV. Who gives a damn about camera angles? Hey, how’s the music coming, Mike? Hmm? Hey, what do you play? Lots of things. Um… viola, violin, piano, some other instruments. Musical like his father. DAVID: What? (KERRY CHUCKLES) Dad’s musical? DORIS: When I first met your father, he was classically trained on the clarinet and had a Music scholarship to University of Texas. (CHUCKLES) DAVID: Wow. But he gave it up to play football at Southern Methodist. Wow. Decided there was no future in music. I chose sport and I was right. He used to play the most beautiful pieces for me when we first dated. DAVID: Aww. Such a well-rounded man. Not like anyone I ever met. Dottie, please. I’ve been meaning to tell everyone, I… well, I got this… I got this quartet that I’m a part of from school and, um, well, we… we actually have a gig. KEVIN: Yeah? Michael, that’s great. When? That’s the thing. It’s… well it’s tonight at UT, Dallas. Oh. No. You’re too young to set foot on a university campus on a Saturday night. Ma… Kev… Kev went on national tour at 17. Excuse me. FRITZ: That was for work. Your mom said no and that’s the end of it. This is work. We’re… We’re getting paid. I mean, we could take him. Yeah. Yeah, we could. We could… He could play the gig, and we’ll leave right after. KERRY: Sure. No. The answer is no. (WINDOW OPENING) (MIKE GRUNTS) KERRY: Shh! (WHISPERING) Get down, get down. Okay, come on.

Yes, sir. I don’t know if you’ve been thinking about your future, but you should think about wrestling. Now, I wouldn’t wish wrestling on any of you. I only wrestled to provide for you all. And I always hoped you boys would choose another profession. But the Olympics has been taken from you the way professional football was taken from me. The world keeps taking from us, and I’m sick of it. I wanna fight back. And the more of us in it together, the better. So, Kerry, I want you to join your brothers in the ring.

FRITZ: There you go. Now, you’ve made this about Georgia versus Texas and it isn’t. It’s about filth versus decency. And you know it. And we’re here today to restore justice and order to the wrestling federation that our father built with his own two hands. The hands that were passed down to us. The hands that will deliver the Iron Claw to you. (CROWD CHEERING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING, CHEERING) (KEVIN GRUNTS) RING ANNOUNCER: Welcome to WCCW. The only promotion being broadcast worldwide.

Gordy kicks out and Hayes elbows his own man. Kerry moving out of the way just in time. All hell has broken loose. Kevin tossing Michael Hayes through the ropes, the Ref trying to restore some order here. He forces Kevin back to his corner. Buddy Roberts comes in. Twoonone on Kerry. Oh, no. But Kerry flips Buddy over the top rope. Kerry off the ropes with a cross body. Terry Gordy catches him. What he’s going to do with him? Here comes David with a dropkick. Kerry falls on Gordy.

(CROWD CHEERING, WHOOPING) We’re sending a message to Sam Muchnick and every other territory out there in the NWA. WCCW is the best in the business. (CROWD CHEERING) The Von Erichs are the best in the business. And we’re coming for you all. (CHEERING, HOOTING) Well, Fritz, calling out the man who runs the NWA on air by name. That’s a bold and unprecedented move. It’s necessary, Bill, because I will make it my life’s work to see to it that David Von Erich will be the next NWA World Heavyweight Champion. (CROWD CHEERING, WHOOPING) And then each and every one of my sons starting with Kevin, then Kerry, then Mike. (CHEERING, HOOTING) All one day will lift that World Heavyweight title belt, because the Von Erich’s are and will forever be the greatest family in the history of wrestling.

We are finally getting a World Heavyweight title shot with Ric Flair. And they want it to be you, David. Don’t look to your brother. This is your time, your opportunity. You’ve been chosen. You earned it. You’ll go on the road and feud with Flair in every territory in America over the next six months. Then you’ll go to Japan. You can’t be World Champion unless you win over Japan. Then you’ll fight with Flair at Parade of Champions in May at Texas Stadium. Are you up for it? Of course, I am. I love you, Pop. I love you too, son. I’ve waited my whole life to have that belt. We’ve had a couple of setbacks, but I can feel it. If you perform, the title will be ours. Now, this wouldn’t be happening without the two of you. You’ve made your brother better, and your collective effort has pushed him to the top. Keep it up out there. You never know when your opportunity will come. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Fuck yeah, David. Fuck yeah.

It’s hard to see clearly in this dark moment, but we cannot let this tragedy define us. Our greatness will be measured by our response to adversity. Now, David’s title match against Ric Flair at Parade of Champions is a moment of a lifetime. We still have a chance to bring the World Heavyweight Championship home if one of you will step up and wrestle in his place. Everything we have ever worked for in the ring is riding on this moment. I’ll do it. I can do it, Dad. KERRY: I can do it, too. Kerry, I’ll do it. I’m ready, Dad. I want it. You don’t have to. It’s my mess. No! I deserve it, too! Boys, boys. It’s a tough decision. You are the oldest Kev, but Kerry’s been getting the most heat lately. We’re gonna flip a coin. That’s the only fair way to decide. Heads for Kerry. Tails for Kevin.

Step over to the hold from Flair, and Kerry puts a stop to that. He knocks it away. Here’s Flair, to the ropes. Wants to toss Kerry, but… Kerry’s… Kerry’s got him. He’s got him in a backslide. (SIGHS) BILL (ON TV): There’s the pin. Two, Three. The dream has come true, yes! Kerry Von Erich, the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. He wins it for his brother David, for his father Fritz. And for the whole Von Erich family. RING ANNOUNCER: The Winner and new World Heavyweight Champion, Kerry Von Erich! (CROWD CHEERING FADES) Hey, I didn’t know you were still here.

(CRYING) (KEVIN BREATHING HEAVILY) (DOOR OPENS) Hey, Doc. Kevin. Fritz. How’d it go? Um, we completed the surgery as planned. We repaired the shoulder, but it was trickier than we anticipated. Mike’s temperature skyrocketed. We worked really hard to bring it down, but it was close to 107 degrees for almost two hours. We believe he suffered toxic shock syndrome. FRITZ: What does that mean? DOCTOR: I’m sorry to say that Mike is in a coma. KEVIN: What? How? It was a routine shoulder surgery. DOCTOR: Well, it’s rare, but it happens. All we can do now is wait and pray he pulls through. I’m very sorry. KEVIN: Why is this happening to us? Why does it just keep happening? PAM (ON PHONE): Okay, baby, stay with me. Okay? But it keeps happening. It’s taken over. PAM: It was a',\n",

I should’ve stopped him. PAM: No. No. What could you do, Kevin? There is no getting through to that man. (BABY CRYING) PAM: Hey. Hey, hon. I’m late for work, and I can’t get him to settle. Can you take him for me? I can’t. What? Just… Okay, just take him till your mom gets here. I gotta go. (BABY CRYING) I can’t. Kevin? Kevin! Come on. Yeah. Sorry. Here. Oh, honey, I’m sorry. (BABY CRYING) Hey. It’s okay. It’s okay. Thank you all for coming, and thank you all the love and support. REPORTER 1: Hey, Mike, are you feeling okay? Yeah. We’re all just so excited that Mike pulled through. Shows how much of a fighter he is. And, uh… after losing David, it’s just… it’s too much to think that we almost lost Mike, too. I… I’m moved that, uh, my whole family is here with me through everything. And, uh… that y’all out there sent flowers. Uh, and, um, I’m thankful to everyone. REPORTER 1: So what’s the timeframe for your return to the ring, Mike? I know I’ll be back, uh, soon. Yeah, soon. Mike’s a fighter more than people even realize, I think. And he’s gonna be back in the ring in no time. (KEVIN CLEARS THROAT) (BABY CRYING) (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHEERING, WHOOPING) CROWD: (CHANTING) One, two, three!

Maybe you should do something else with your life. Why? So, you’re the only brother left in the ring? You get all daddy’s attention? Fuck you. I want you in the ring. I can’t do this by myself!

(GRUNTS) (PANTING) (CROWD CHEERING) RING ANNOUNCER: This match is scheduled for one fall and it’s for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. BILL (ON TV): Now, Ric, there’s been a lot of talk that you’ve been resisting coming down to the Sportatorium to defend your title against Kevin Von Erich. It is so hard to be humble when you’re looking like Ric Flair. You see the difference between me and a lot of these so-called bigtime stars is that I’m custom-made from head to toe. That’s why I’ve got the biggest house, on the biggest hill on the biggest side of town. That’s why this sports coat costs $800. And I don’t know what that costs! I’d be ashamed to wear it! That’s why I’ve got on lizard shoes and a Rolex watch, and I’ve got a limousine out there, a mile-long with 25 women in it just dying for me to go, whoo! Now, let’s get to the less-pretty facts of life. Kevin, your daddy got together with the powers that be and ordered me back down here to Dallas a nothing-happenin’, second-rate sports community. I am the World’s Heavyweight Champion, because I am the greatest wrestler alive today, the toughest wrestler alive today. I have bled and sweat for this title and no daddy’s boy is going to take that from me. RIC (ON TV): This is professional wrestling. It is the most grueling of all professional sports. I’ve been stabbed, hit by chairs, beat up by everybody. I don’t cry. I don’t complain. I carry on. But the bottom line is… BILL (ON TV): You’re denying RIC (ON TV): I am talking right now. Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. I’ll tell you what, you like talking to me on the show. You’ll listen to me talk while I’m out here. (CROWD CHEERING) The bottom line is, if you’re a man, you take the ups and downs. If you’re a real man, you’ll never go down. You’ll just stay up. That’s why I am the World’s Heavyweight Champion. And I can go through Kevin Von Erich, or any Von Erich in the worst day of my life. (CROWD CHEERING) ',\n",

We can get the guys touring during the week. Bring ’em home for a Saturday night. BILL: That sounds painful, but smart. The numbers just haven’t been there since Kerry went to the WWF. Jerry called again this morning, It’s a good offer. You should think about it. (INDISTINCT COMMENTARY) Hey, Dad. So, we have an offer on the table from Jerry Jarrett. He wants to buy us out. (INDISTINCT COMMENTARY ON TV) Son, I didn’t give you the company so you could turn around and sell it. I need to think about my family, Dad. I’m almost broke. We need a house. And we can’t fit in that apartment anymore. If you sell, you can forget about stepping through these doors again. Damn, you’re almost 40 years old. Still can’t take care of yourself. I’ve been through the books. It doesn’t add up. I didn’t make nearly what it says I did. I did what was right all along. You think living here was a free ride? Don’t you dare question me.
